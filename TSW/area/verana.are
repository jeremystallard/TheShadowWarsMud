Peninsula.  It is a relatively wide road paved with gray stone and
overlooked by lots of white buildings.  Most of these buildings are white
plaster covered structures whose pale brown brickwork is revealed in the odd
crack or chip.  The style of the small buildings is rather peculiar for they
are built with flat roofs and no windows looking out over the streets.

Panarch's Road is Verana Peninsula's main road.  It is a broad road paved
with dull gray stone and lined with white buildings.  Nearly all of these
buildings have white plaster covering their outer walls but the grander and
more elaborate structures have been built from white stone.  Two of
Tanchico's most famous landmarks are situated near this point, to the
northwest is the Panarch's Palace and to the south is the Panarch's Circle.

Tanchico, this one has been paved with dull gray slabs of stone that look

tall grandly constructed houses whose snowy white plaster exteriors attempt

This is a broad road paved with dull gray stones, much like the rest of
the city of Tanchico.  What makes this particular street stand out is the
huge white stone palace that lies along the south side, the tall towers and
gilded domes make it easily recognizable as the Panarch's Palace.  Along the
opposite side of the road are less flamboyant constructions that consist
mainly of the abodes of the city's wealthy traders and merchants.

This is the west end of Verana Street, a particularly broad thoroughfare
that follows the northern edge of the grounds of the Panarch's Palace. 
There are grandly built merchants' houses along the north side of the road
but they pale into comparison with the huge white stone palace and its tall
towers and gilded domes.  To the south is one of the side entrances into the
Palace's grounds.

This is the north lobby located in the Panarch's Circle, the second
largest of Tanchico's three huge stadiums.  Although the majestic white
stone structure is huge, it is not as tall as the Panarch's Palace that is
situated elsewhere on the Verana Peninsula.  A wide gallery follows the
entire inner circumference of the building with tall yet narrow arched
windows looking out over the arena floor.  There are detailed reliefs of
great trees with spreading leafy boughs carved into the outer wall of the
gallery.  Finally there is an iron gateway built into the inner wall which
is all that stands in the way of accessing the arena floor.

The arena floor is a huge circular field of hard-packed dirt that is
enclosed inside the white stone structure of the Panarch's Circle.  The
inner wall is roughly fifteen feet in height and has elaborate friezes of
horse races and other grand events that are held inside the enormous
building.  Behind the inner wall are the spectators' seats that form
concentric circles around the arena, rising like steep steps of white stone.
There are four arched gateways built into the inner wall that appear to be
the only routes in or out of the arena floor.

This is the south lobby located in the Panarch's Circle, the second
largest of Tanchico's three huge stadiums.  Although the impressive white
stone structure is enormous, it is not as tall as the Panarch's Palace that
is located elsewhere on the Verana Peninsula.  A spacious gallery follows
the entire inner circumference of the building with tall yet slim arched
windows looking out over the arena floor.  Complex reliefs of great trees
with spreading leafy boughs have been carved into the outer wall of the
gallery.  Lastly there is an iron gateway built into the inner wall which is
all that stands in the way of accessing the arena floor.

{cThe Panarch's Palace{x - A Side Entrance~
A broad road paved with slabs of white stone leads up the side of a steep
grassy hill.  At the top of the hill is a vast palace built from white stone
with tapering towers and huge golden domes.  At the bottom of the road is a
tall black iron gateway that seems to be the only way beyond a tall white
stone wall that has been built around the bottom of the hill.

{cThe Panarch's Palace{x - The Delivery Yard~
In some respects this yard is quite large but when compared to other
palaces it is relatively small.  The white stone paved courtyard lies
somewhere at the rear of a tall palace that belongs to the Panarch of
Tarabon.  The majority of the activity in this area is limited to deliveries
to the palace made by carts and wagons that traverse a steeply sloping road
leading from the yard to one of the side gates.  On the east side of the
yard is a wide set of reinforced dark wood doors that lead into the main
building itself.

This is a large square courtyard that sprawls out before the Panarch's
Palace, a grand construction of white stone topped with tapering towers and
golden domes.  Tall fluted columns made of white marble border the
courtyard, and in turn the columns are bordered by ornamental topiaries. 
Two roads lead off from the courtyard but the one of most interest is the
wide one that leads down the side of the hill towards the main gateway.

facade depicts racing horses whilst inside the building is a more austere
and functional.  There are dozens of stalls lining the west and east sides
of the stable, with at the south end is a large space reserved for the
storage of carriages and other equipment.  There is only one exit from this
building, a wide set of doors on the north side that lead out into a grand

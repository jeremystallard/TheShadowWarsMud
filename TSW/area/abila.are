{cNorth Abila Bridge{x~
This is a simple timber bridge crosses over a twisting stream that almost
completely encircles the town of Abila.  The bridge looks heavily worn down
in places by the many years of traffic that have crossed it.  There is a
wide muddy track that leads away from the bridge to the north; it is the
main trading route from Amadicia to Ghealdan.  The road south of the bridge
has been paved with slabs of stone and is in excellent condition unlike the
bridge.  The tall stone watchtowers of the town are clearly visible from
this point; they seem to over shadow many of the other buildings of the
town.

This is a wide street paved with slabs of stone that runs through the
northern part of the town of Abila.  A second slightly narrower street runs
east/west through the town intersecting this road.  Many of the buildings
that overlook this road are tall; some are up to four stories in height. 
Huge stone watchtowers that would not look too much out of place in the
Borderlands overlook the buildings themselves.  To the north the number of
buildings appears to dwindle as the road approaches the outskirts of the
town towards a large wooden bridge.

This is a wide street paved with slabs of stone that runs through the

constructed from brick and stone and roofed with slate tiles overlooking
this street; some of the structures are up to four stories in height.  The
majority of the buildings in this part of the town appear to be houses
although one or two shops can be seen too.  In the distance to the south
this road opens up and forms a plaza.

{WOutside Abila{x~
It should be of no surprise that a town such as Abila is so well
defended; the small town is located along a main trade route and would have
been a primary target for bandits and thieves to rob merchants as they rest
here.  Tall watchtowers loom over the rest of the town's buildings, the
sturdy stone towers would not look out of place in a Borderlander town.  A
keen observer would see large numbers of heavily armored soldiers inside the
town which suggest that they either have a camp nearby or a headquarters
inside the town.

It could be said that this town square is the heart of Abila as it is a
popular gathering place for both strangers and locals.  It is a large plaza
paved with slab of stone that is surrounded by tall buildings made of brick
and stone.  A much larger and grander square can be seen just a short
distance away to the east where a colorful marketplace has been set up.  Two
wide paved streets lead away from this square, one route to the north and
the other to the south.  A third, much narrower road leads away from the
square to the west.

slate.

leads through the southern part of Abila.  A second street leads northwards
to what appears to be a large marketplace.  Built in neat rows along this
road are mainly tall gray stone houses.  There are very dark and narrow
alleyways that are almost hidden from view that cut between the rows of
houses.  Overlooking the houses are the watchtowers, ugly stone structures
that loom over the rest of the buildings within this small town; one such
tower is just a short walk away to the south.

Oak Tree Avenue is a wide yet relatively short paved road within Abila
lined with trees.  Overlooking the thoroughfare are numerous tall buildings,
mainly shops and houses, most of the structures are four or five stories in
height and have been roofed with dark slate tiles.  To the south a second,
much longer paved street can be seen that leads east/west through the town,
this road is also flanked by dull gray buildings.  An impressive paved plaza
can be seen just a short distance away to the north where a colorful
marketplace has been set up.

West Street stretches for a considerable distance both to the east and to
the west.  It is a very busy street that is quite narrow and has been paved
with large gray slabs of stone; many of the slabs show signs of heavy wear
and tear.  Built in rows along this street are immense structures made of
brick and stone and roofed with dark gray slate; most of these buildings
appear to be houses although one or two shops visible and even some
warehouses built along the southern side of the road.  There are very gloomy
and narrow alleyways that are almost hidden from view, the alleys cut
between the rows of buildings.

that winds its way through the northern part of the town of Abila. 
Overlooking the street are tall gray stone buildings, mainly houses and
shops although two very large buildings seem to dominate this area.  The
building to west is a large inn which is a surprisingly grand and ornate
structure for a small town of this size.  To the north a much larger
building can be seen, it looks like it was once the home of a wealthy
merchant but now a flag flies from its roof depicting the Thistle of
Amadicia.

fifteen paces in width.  Dark wooden paneling covers the lower half of the

wall seeming bare.  The only side of the platform not marked with a wall is
the eastern side where a railing, also made of dark wood has been built.  A
small flight of steps flanked on both sides with a short wooden railing
leads downwards towards the common room.  A large doorway on the western
side of the platform marks the entrance and exit out of the tavern, two hat

Beneath one of the thick cluster of undergrowth that has sprung up beside
along the sides of the stream that encompasses Abila is a small iron grate
set into the ground.  There is a small trickle of very smelly and sludgy
brown water flowing from a long brickwork tunnel that lies beyond the rusty
metal grating and straight into the stream.  Also visible from this point is

This is the end of one of the many brickwork tunnels that forms the
sewers of Abila.  A cool breeze flows in from the north through a small iron
grate that appears to be corroded in places.  Sewage trickles out of the
grate and flows into a wide stream that is infested with a thick veil of
leafy undergrowth along its banks.

It is a rather large and spacious room, the white plastered walls make the

and pans hang upon a wooden rack from the ceiling.  The plain wooden kitchen
cupboards, drawers and shelves look like they are in a similar state of
disrepair.  There appear to be two exits from this room, a large door on the

totally.  Beside the table are a smaller table and a washstand.  Scrubbed
and polished surgical instruments have been placed with the utmost precision
in a neat arrangement on the table.  Along the length of the rest of the
room are cots for any Whitecloak soldiers injured in duty, all made with
precision and bedding in pristine order.

{WA Narrow Hallway{x~
This is the western end of a long yet narrow windowless hallway.  Both
the walls and the floor of the room have been left as bare gray stone whilst
small brass oil lamps hung from the wooden beams that support the ceiling
light up the area with a dull golden glow.  There are several identical
doorways along this end of the corridor, each door has been reinforced with
strips of iron and appears very sturdy indeed.

{WThe Sleeping Quarters{x~
This is a large rectangular hall that is being used as a dormitory.  Both
the walls and the floor of this room have been left almost bare and
revealing the rounded gray stone blocks used to build this structure.  There
is a series of oblong windows built into the west wall that looks out over
the countryside that surrounds Abila.  The only exit from this room is a
large iron-braced door on the east side of the quarters.

{WA Flagstone Courtyard{x~
This is a large flagstone courtyard that is flanked by several gray stone
buildings.  The most significant buildings appear to be a large stable built
along the southern edge of the yard and a grand structure on the west side
that was probably a wealthy merchant's house long ago; both buildings appear
to be linked together.  There is a large gray stone wall marks the northern
perimeter of the yard with long twisting vines of ivy growing up the sides. 
A large archway appears to be the only way through the wall and beyond the
arch is a long paved street.

This is the eastern end of a long structure made of gray stone and timber
that is being used as a stable.  The area is quite neat and tidy although a
draught running through the building does stir up some fragments of straw
and hay into the air.  Built along the south side of the stable are numerous
large stalls that are used to accommodate horses.  A long wide walkway runs
east/west past the front of the stalls; the floor of the walkway appears to
be packed mud.  Built high above the stalls is a hayloft, which is little
more than a wooden platform supported by support beams that also form each
stall enclosure.  There is a huge set of double doors set on the north side
of the stable that leads outside.

over the edge of the platform.

A rancid smell of sewage emanates from this slow flowing stream that
surrounds the market town of Abila.  The stream is quite wide and deep, the
incline of the rocky banks suggests that this channel was manmade and not
natural.  The undergrowth that grows along the banks of this waterway
appears to be thriving despite how stony the soil is in this area.  The tall
stone buildings of the town can be seen to the south from here but the bank
is too steep and overgrown to ascend.

{CAlong The Stream{x~
What was once a beautiful crystal clear stream is now a stinking brown
soup-like concoction.  The stream itself disappears through a small gap
between two large rocks; the gap is far too narrow to pass.  Faint echoes of
splashing and running water can be heard, perhaps from an underground stream
or river, but they do not seem to be originating from the gap between the
rocks.

{GThe Hedge Doctor's Workshop{x~
The owner of this small and simple shop in Abila is making quite good
trade on selling potions and medicines to townsfolk and travelers alike. 
This is very surprising, as trading medicines is an extremely risky business
for anyone to undertake in any Amadician town.  The majority of healers in
Amadicia are hedge doctors who specialize in herbal remedies, for obvious
reasons female healers are practically unheard of in this country.  On the
walls hang several large canvas posters with sketches of human anatomy,
indicating which places to apply leeches to cure certain ailments.

interest in the local area.  A high-backed armchair stand nearby the
fireplace at the north end of the room, its occupant is an elderly ginger
tomcat who basks in the warmth of the dancing flames.  Occasionally faint
voices pass by outside the partially curtained windows and disappear out of
earshot, leaving only constant crackling of the open fire and soft ticking
sound from an old clock upon the mantelpiece.

pieces of junks mingled with them.  At the north end of the room is a small
doorway leading into the shopkeeper's quarters and placed in front of this
door is a large wooden counter.  At the opposite side of the shop is a
second doorway that leads outside into a busy street.

a {RQ{Wueen{w'{Rs G{Wuar{Rd{w of Aringill~
An impressive-looking {RQ{Wueen{w'{Rs G{Wuar{Rd{w of Aringill stands near the gate.
~
Blinding {Wsnow white{w and {Rheart's-blood red{w trappings adorn the impressive
figure of a man who guards the open gate of Aringill.  Despite the distance
Aringill is from Caemlyn, the people of this city feel an abundance of pride
to be Andoran.  It could be the fact that Aringill sits so close to the
Cairheinin border.  The {Ru{Wniform{Rs{w and pay these {RQ{Wueen{w'{Rs G{Wuard{Rs{w receive comes
mostly from the city's {Ycoffers{w, though it is augmented by the {RRose {YCrown{w
These men take their duties seriously; it is best to be on about your
business and not antagonize this man.

entails keeping sailors and other transients out of trouble.

A somewhat plump serving girl, with her hair braided along both sides of
her head and held together in a single braid in the back, is busy helping
out the clientele of the Grand Wickergarden Retreat.  If you need anything

The {Ymoney{w-changer, a woman named Aleise, stands behind the desk.
~
Aleise is one of those women who have aged and will continue to age
gracefully.  {yL{wi{ygh{wt {ybro{ww{yn{w hair, somewhat wavy, falls to her shoulders.  It is
streaked with thin strands of {Wwhite{w but not enough to call it
{Wsalt{w-and-{Dpepper{w, yet.  Small wrinkles at the corners of her mouth only
accent that the flesh of her cheeks still has a good deal of color.  She is
of middlin' height but looks shorter due to the guards she has hired that
watch your every move.

This Andoran guard is a rather big man.  Hired to intimidate, his size
may be of more importance than his actual skill with weapons but finding out
would perhaps be foolhardy.  His nose has been squashed flat, either from
some freak accident or a previous fight.  He keeps an eye on the
{Ymoney{w-changer and the patrons to her business.

Illustration: A {Wwhite goat{w with a smile on its face stands by a {yfence{w in
a field of {Ggreen grass{w and {Yco{Rlo{Yr{Bfu{Wl bu{Rt{Yt{Ber{Wf{Mli{Yes{w.  

{CMilly{w the {Wgoat{w lived happily with the other {Wgoats{w in her herd.  There was
plenty of {Ggreen grass{w to eat and fresh {Cblue water{w to drink.  But {CMilly{w had a
problem.  She wanted to know what was on the other side of the {yfence{w.

Illustration: A small {Wwhite{w goat in a field of {Ggreen grass{w looks confused
as it faces a larger {Wwhite{w goat.  A {yfence{w is in the background.  

{CMilly{w the {Wgoat{w asked her mother what was on the other side of the fence. 
Her mother said, "{MWhy ever would you want to know Milly?  I've never been on
the other side of the fence.  Everything you could ever want is here.  Green
grass, fresh water, and your friends.  {w" {CMilly{w, not satisfied with the
answer went to ask her father.  She got much the same answer from him and
from her friends.  
~

page4~
Illustration: A {Wwhite{w goat stands next to a {Yduck{w by a {Bpond{w.  A {yfence{w is
in the background.  

{CMilly{w the {Wgoat{w, tried asking some other people what was on the other side of
the fence.  She asked the hedgehog but he didn't know.  She asked the turtle
but he didn't know either.  She asked the fish, but the fish said she didn't
know what {CMilly{w was talking about.  Finally, {CMilly{w the {Wgoat{w asked the duck. 
The duck was known by everyone to be a braggart.  The duck said, "{MOh I've
been on the other side of the fence.  {w" 

{CMilly{w, curious leaned in closer, "{CWhat is it like?  {w"

The duck ruffled his feathers and said, "{MIt is a large place.  It is so big
you could walk for days and never see the end of it.  {w" Dunking his head
under the water the duck took a drink of water and continued, "{MThe grass is
greener on the other side of the fence you know?  It is sweeter too.  {w"
{CMilly{w, wanting to see the other side for herself trotted off before the duck
could tell her the rest.

page5~
Illustration: A {Wwhite{w goat jumps over a {yfence{w.  

{CMilly{w the {Wgoat{w, looked at the other side of the fence for days.  She began
to believe that the other side _was_ greener, and that her own grass didn't
taste as sweet.  She tried to think about how she would get to the other
side.  She couldn't fly, and she was too big to go under the fence.  She
decided she would have to jump.  She practiced jumping until she could jump
higher than any other goat, (she had gotten a few pointers from the rabbit
and her children).  {CMilly{w said goodbye to her mother and father and friends
and ran toward the fence and jumped over it.  She was there!  She finally
was on the other side!  
~
E
page6~
Illustration: A {Wwhite{w goat is pictured running across a wide {Ggreen{w field.  

{CMilly{w the {Wgoat{w, looked around after she was on the other side of the fence. 
She sampled the grass and was dissapointed that it didn't taste any
different.  Maybe the duck meant that the grass tasted sweeter away from the
fence.  So {CMilly{w trotted a few spans away from the fence and tasted the
grass.  It wasn't any different.  {CMilly{w kept wandering a few paces at a time
and each time she tasted the grass it was no different.  {CMilly{w decided she
would run as far as she could to find the sweet grass the duck talked about.

Standing atop a hot bed of {Dc{roa{Dls{x is {DT{my{rkh{mo{Dn{x, muscular chest and biceps
slightly flexed, the {rh{Do{rrns{x on his otherwise bald head sharp, and his long,
pointy {Dt{rai{Dl{x swept out behind him.  He wears a {Db{go{Gx{ge{Dr-br{Gie{Df{x cut swimsuit as he
trails one foot in the hot {rl{Ra{rv{Ra{x stream that flows by.  A seductive and

hair waves in the wind behind her, her translucent {Cw{Wi{Cngs{x held back, little
sparkles shinning in the light as small drops of rain fall upon her skin. 
She rests the glittery skin of her cheek against her knees and smiles at
whoever painted the portrait.

Andoran Way~
Flapping in a faint breeze are banners showing the personal emblem of the
{RQ{Wuee{Rn{w, and the rampant lion of {RA{Wndo{Rr{w.  Under the banners are {RQ{Wueen{w'{Rs G{Wuard{Rs{w,
likely not paid for by the {Ycrown{w here at the border of {RA{Wndo{Rr{w, but impressive
none-the-less.  Aringill is not a walled city, and a gatehouse here at the
edge of the dirt road leading to Caemlyn seems a bit ostentatious.

Andoran Way~
Here near the city limits of Aringill you can take a quick survey of your
surroundings.  Westward leads to the road heading back toward Caemlyn
Between Aringill and Caemlyn is mostly farmland.  Andor is rich in game, and
produce.  If you travel through Aringill to the east you will eventually
come to the Erinnin.  Across it is Cairhien, home of the topless towers and
the {YSun Thr{yo{Yne{w.  This thoroughfare, named Andoran Way, seems to have a good
many {Bpa{bt{Wro{bl{Bman{w watching out for the welfare of Aringill's inhabitants.

Near the end/beginning of Andoran Way here in Aringill you can see the
purposeful members of the constabulary patrolling the streets.  The soft
shuffling of {y{y{yhorses{w{w{w is interrupted by a louder nicker.  It is now that you
can smell the heavily permeating scent of {yhorse{w coming from the hitching
posts set up just to the north.

People, on pressing business, move past you as you come to a road connecting
to Andoran Way.  The road heads northward and is aptly given the name of
North Road.  It curves around the side of a three-story building.  Every now
and then a member of the constabulary patrols the intersection, watching
what goes on in the streets of Aringill.

A teenage boy is spoken to harshly by a cook opening a window from the

he closes the window and moves back to continue whatever task he was doing.

who have the {Ycoin{w.

As you travel down Andoran Way, one of Aringill's main thoroughfares, you
notice a large three-story building just to the north.  Standing back on the
southern edge of the road you can discover that the door lies a short ways
to the east.  {DShadows{w play across a closed drape as {Yl{yampl{Yi{yght{w from inside is
blocked by a body.  After a moment the {Yl{yampl{Yi{yght{w filters through showing the
vague shapes of seated people, judging by the {Dshadows{w cast by patron's
heads.

An impressive three-story structure stands along the edge of Andoran Way.
A painted wooden placard depicts a {Yy{ye{Yllow{w-haired woman wearing {Rred{w and
{Wwhite{w, obviously meant to depict the {RQ{Wuee{Rn{w of {RA{Wndo{Rr{w.  Curtains from a
third-story window billows outward as you observe the structure.  There is a
gathering of merchants just outside the door of the inn.  Oddly, there seems
to be no rowdy laughter or boisterous singing coming from inside of the inn.

In the northwest corner of this four-way intersection stands a large,
impressive three-story building, an inn of some sort perhaps.  Many people,
locals and foreigners seem to transverse this section of road heading in all
four directions.  The east-west Andoran Way is wider than the cobblestoned
north-south Lillylake Drive, but decidedly cleaner to the south than to the
north.

A scent floats down this portion of Andoran Way, {rsp{Yi{rcy{w and {Msweet{w.  It
comes from the small stand just north of the roadway.  A crowd of people,
locals and foreigners alike, wait to be served by the vendor.  It seems not
only are people hoping to get something from the stand, but a scrawny {ydog{w
seems to be lurking around, hoping for someone to drop a tasty tidbit, ready
to gobble it up.

Andoran Way~
Locals of Aringill pass by you minding their own businesses for the most
part as you travel along Andoran Way.  As you continue your journey you
notice that the north side of the road is a barrier to a ditch running
perhaps, a pace deep in some places to almost a span in others.  Weeds and
fresh piles of {ydirt{w seem to occupy the ditch.  Over it you can see what
looks to be some sort of construction site, or work camp.  Carts drawn by
mules are the focal point of great interest to people lifting and moving
small objects onto them.  The ditch follows the road to the east.

Andoran Way~
As you travel along Andoran Way, one of the main thoroughfares of
Aringill, you notice an empty ditch somewhat clogged with weeds and piles of
fresh {ydirt{w.  This ditch lies just north of the street.  On the other side of
the ditch seems to be a lot of activity, workmen seem to be loading up carts
in some sort of order.  A closer inspection might reveal what is going on. 
Just east of here Andoran Way spills out into a large intersection.

Intersection of Andoran and Archer's Ways~
A great many people create a crowded intersection at this portion of road. 
The influx of mule-drawn carts, both empty and laden with {rbricks{w do not help
the congestion.  Archer's Way is a broad avenue filled with such carts
heading northward, and toward this intersection.  The traffic from the other
main thoroughfare, Andoran Way flows into this cart-traffic and gives
incentive to the idea that the spot you are standing in is not the most
ideal if you wish to not get your toes trodden by a hard hoof or a wobbly
wheel.

Andoran Way~
You are traveling along Andoran Way, just east of its intersection with
Archer's Way.  The road you are traveling on cuts across Aringill in almost
a straight line east-west.  As different people pass by and along side of
you, you might notice that this portion of the road, being so heavily
trafficked, may make someone standing still an easy target for cutpurses. 
It might be wise to keep moving along.  Was that villager standing just a
little to close to you just now?

Andoran Way~
The paved street, of Andoran Way, beneath your feet is covered by a thin
layer of hard-packed {yearth{w.  Just to either side of the center of the road
the {yearth{w shows a small, bare, strip revealing the closely fitted stones
where traffic has worn the {ydirt{w away.  A thin film of dust covers the
exposed stones, likely a by-product of mud from the last good rainstorm. 
There must be a need for construction materials as mule-drawn carts laden
with earthen {rbricks{w constantly pass on by heading eastwards.  Empty carts
head in a westerly direction, presumably to be filled up once again with
{rbricks{w.

Traveling along Andoran Way and stopping for a moment you can observe the
populace of Aringill.  Most of the village folk are {Dd{ya{Drk{w of hair and eye,
though occasionally someone of lighter coloring does wander on by.  Here and
there shorter Cairhienin are spotted, immigrants, merchants, hired hands. 
Their shorter stature and pale skin stands out.  However, most of the
Cairhienin wandering about wear clothing that fits into Andoran standards. 
Andoran Way continues eastwards toward the Erinnin, and westward toward the
intersection of Andoran and Archer's Ways.

Andoran Way~
As you move through the streets of Aringill and head down this section of
Andoran Way, you can quietly observe the different people walking down the
streets.  This section of town seems to hold a majority of townsfolk, as
opposed to transient sailors.  Across from a sturdy shop lies a lone
crumbled earthen {rbrick{w on the ground; likely it fell off of one of the
mule-driven carts hauling the man-made stones around this portion of the
city.

Andoran Way~
This portion of Andoran Way lacks shelter from the {Ysun{w during mid-day,
and from the spring and winter {crains{w.  The shops lining this portion of the
thoroughfare seem to be mostly abandoned, and half have been torn down.  No
construction is being accomplished, though mule-drawn carts carrying loads
of earthen {rbricks{w regularly pass this stretch of roadway.

The flux of people wandering Andoran Way thins somewhat as a mule-drawn
cart, loaded with {rbricks{w takes up the center of the roadway.  A second
mule-drawn cart is empty and heading in the opposite direction, though
nearer to the edge of the paved street.  Eastwards a small gathering
composed of women and children can be seen.

Aringill's Well~
Children, old enough to reliably hold a heavy clay jug, and women can be
found talking and waiting in line at Aringill's well.  Though built near a
fresh source of water, the Erinnin, it is more convenient for many villagers
to draw their water from here.  Several of the older girls, and some of the
women frown as a careless passerby, wheeling a barrow filled with earthen
bricks, kicks up dust.  Running south from the well is a road, not quite as
wide as Andoran Way.

A large {gle{yathe{yrl{geaf{w sits just off to one side of the road.  Its heavy
boughs brush against the heads of some of the more careless passersby.  A
couple, picnics in the shade under the tree.  The rustle of last year's
{gle{ya{rf{Y-{rl{yit{gt{ye{gr{w can be heard from under the {Wc{Rh{We{Rc{Wk{Re{Wd{w spread that they are sitting
on.  Foot traffic slows as they approach the tree and look at the couple
curiously before heading off in the direction they were going.

be seen passing over the packed earth and stone-paved street.  Here and
there a child can be spotted picking up assorted bits of debris as if
finding great treasures.  A soft breeze is felt, giving a slight breath of
cool air to the stuffy street.

You are walking along Andoran Way, one of the main thoroughfares of
Aringill.  The street is paved with closely fitted slabs of rock covered by
a thin layer of packed earth, though the paving stones can be seen where the
dirt is becoming thin from the wear of traffic.  A weaving flow of foot
traffic goes in both directions.

A small procession of children, march in twos or threes, then stop at a
shout from the child in the rear.  At this shout they scramble for some
position, determined by the children and known only to the rules of their
made up game.  A {Rred r{ri{Rbb{ro{Rn{w flutters from one of the girls' hair and lands
on the paved street.

Andoran Way~
Just east, of this section of Andoran Way, the sloped and tiled roof of
one of Aringill's inns can be seen.  Along with the sight is the sound of
laughter, the music of a stringed bittern, and the melodious voice of a
woman singing.  Because of the time, or because their owner's wish to take a
break from the bartering, several shops lining the street are closed for the
day.  A few high-flying {Wgulls{w can be seen hovering a ways to the east,
presumably over the banks of the Erinnin.

The Sailor's Rest, a tiled roof inn with {Wp{wal{We {Yye{wllo{Yw{w wooden slats is the
source of the singing voice.  The melody changes every few minutes.  The
voice is at odds with the music heard out here in the street.  Not only can
the bittern be heard coming from the Sailor's Rest, but a lute is heard from
the inn across the street just down a short ways to the east.  The
shimmering ribbon of {cb{Dl{cue{w-{Dg{cr{Dey{w, the river Erinnin, can be seen just a short
ways down the road to the east.

Across the street on either edge of Andoran Way the sides of modest inns
can be seen.  One with a tiled roof, the other wooden shingles, both however
are far from new, but neither has been allowed to be run down into the
ground.  Music, and laughter can be heard, as well as fragments of song sung
by a female voice.  A sure attractor for the transient male populace.

Competing music and raucous laughter from two inns on different sides of the
street create a cacophony.  The ebb and flow of locals, and transients show
that this is a good locale for supporting an inn.  A door goes slightly ajar
for a moment before it slams shut due to a sudden breeze.  The door opens
again a few minutes later to let out a pair of staggering sailors from the
interior of The Suds and Bristles Inn.  Their gait on land is already
hampered by the rhythms they are used to on a ship and the imbibing of large
quantity of drink does not help them.  The slightly sour smell of mud from
the river can be detected once the breeze kicks up again.

The fetid stench of decaying things, and pitch is noticeable here, so
close to the Erinnin.  Sweaty dock laborers, slump-shouldered, trudge
eastwards back to work, or westward, toward their homes.  The roiling gait
of sailors weave between the slow moving laborers in both directions.  The
tide of humanity displaces fish-catching and garbage-eating {Wwh{wi{Wte {wand gr{De{wy
{Wgulls{w.  Their large wingspan cast shadows that mingle with those of the
crowd.

Intersection of Andoran Way and Dock Road~
The fetid stench of decaying things, and {Dpitch{w permeates this stretch of
road.  It is here that the wide, paved, main road, Andoran Way, intersects
with a narrower, yet still busy section of road called simply: Dock Road. 
{yMud{w litters the ground here, tracked in by careless people trying to skirt
along the edge of a {ymuddy{w bank just to the east.  Mule drawn carts and dock
laborers toil, carrying loads to and from various ships docked to the north.
The traffic lessens in the opposite direction.

Gatehouse~
Built off to the side of Andoran Way is this small structure of earthen

a place to write out reports, and a convenient shelter from the elements. 
Unless you've been specifically asked to step inside, it would be wise to
continue about your own business.

{rch{yer{rry{ywood{w paneling is found on the walls, giving a welcoming feel to the

Several lacquered tables with {Doil {Yl{ya{Ymps{w are found in this room.  Seated
in small groups are what appear to be prosperous merchants from several
different lands.  The quiet conversations are mostly about cargo and
cultures.  Instead of entertainment, the Good Queen seems to focus on good
food and comfort for their guests.  The wonderful smells of finely prepared
food come from both the plates on the tables and from behind the door to the
west where a serving woman is seen, time to time, emerging with filled
plates.  A door set in the northern wall leads to a private dining area for
customers willing to pay just a little bit more.

Kitchen of the Good Queen~
A team of inspired cooks collaborate with each other over the merits of one
{rsp{Yi{rce{w over the other.  The Good Queen has a reputation, and most of that
reputation rides on the food served in this establishment.  As the cooks
come to a consensus, a small sprinkling of a {rsp{Yi{rce{w is placed in a saute pan
along with strips of mutton.  The {Ys{Wi{Yzzl{wi{Yng{w meat might serve as a reminder
for hunger.

not be heard outside of the room.  As you are served a fine meal in this
room, you are told that a special, room for the evening can be rented.  The
young man, a member of the Good Queen's staff, has the key and instructions
on how to get there.

where {Dtins{w of {rsp{Yi{rces{w and bottles of oil are stored.  Hanging from hooks set
in the ceiling are large slabs of salted meats.  Roots are sorted in bins
along with fruits like {Rapp{Yl{Res{w.  What isn't stored here, is likely purchased
fresh in the city for the cooks to prepare into delicious meals.

several places.  The paneling was obviously not made to stand up to the
humidity here.  Heading east will take you to the stairs to the third floor.

ammenities are found in this room as well.  The door back to the hallway

Hallway with an Open Window~
An open {cwindow{w allows faint voices and sounds in from Andoran Way far
below.  The breeze causes the flames in the {Doil {Yl{ya{Ymps{w to flicker slightly. 
The row of {yb{rr{Ya{yss{w hooks that hold the {Yl{ya{Ymps{w is missing a member from its
ranks.  Perhaps someone needed additional lighting and borrowed one.  Doors
are found on both sides of the hallway.

security.  A door in the wall to the north blends in with the {rt{yo{rn{yes{w of the
walls.  Making it hard to see.  Opposite of the door is the hallway leading
to the stairs up to the second floor.

A Closet~
This is a closet located within the Good Queen, one of Aringill's largest
inns.  Unlike the rest of this inn, this closest is small and confirmed
space.  There are numerous cleaning supplies are found in this closet
including brooms, dustpans, pails, mops, and cakes of soap.  The general
clutter and lack of organization found within this room leads to the
conclusion that this closest was not intended for guests to inspect.

Short clipped {ggrass{w is found all around the {ypoles{w, one {yhorse{w attached by a

building to the west does the same in the afternoons.  This road terminates
to the south where it intersects with Andoran Way.  The North Road continues

is strongest just a little bit further north.

You are traveling along North Road, one of Aringill's thoroughfares. 
From the lowest floor of an impressive three-story structure is the strong
scent of {yhorse{w.  Upon closer inspection it looks as if some inn has actually
intergrated a stable into its main building.  A look to a sign by the door
shows the proclamation of ownership.

North Road~
As you travel along North Road you spy a small side-street running along
just behind a tall structure to the south.  The packed dirt choked with
weeds does not look like it goes anywhere important, unlike North Road
itself.  Just northward you can hear merchants touting the quality of their
wares.  There is a large, three-story building just to the south, an inn of
some sort where the odor of a stable is fairly strong.

Aringill Mudflats~

Small freshwater {ycr{ra{ybs{w scurry sideways picking up small bits of {yearth{w and
rubbish in their claws.  A mob of {Wgulls{w with large wingspans, squawk and
fight over a half-eaten {Bf{Ci{Bsh{w laying in the stench-filled {ymud{w.  The Erinnin

Rocky Shore~

over these rocks, though the {ysand{w and small pebbles to the east certainly

before you slip and fall.

The delineation between wet sand and dry sand is quite evident.  Next to

shore from the ships moving through the water.  It becomes so wet to the
north that the sand has become a quagmire of stagnate water and filth laden
{ymud{w.  Dry sand stretches from where you are standing all the way to the
conglomeration of large jagged rocks to your immediate west.

common everyday thing, hardly noticed.  With the Erinnin just to the east
and gliding {Wgulls{w a frequent sight, it cannot be avoided.  Dock Road runs
almost parallel with the Erinnin until it meets up with Andoran Way just to

the {yplanks{w of the boardwalk just to the east.

Boardwalk~
Heavy {ytimbers{w, sealed with {Dpitch{w, are firmly anchored to create the
boardwalk.  This is a place to take a leisurely stroll, or to gaze out
across the Erinnin wondering about life in Maerone, in Cairhien, across the
{criver{w.  Many fishermen also take advantage of the boardwalk as a place to
cast their lines hoping for a bite.  While Dock Road is raised just a hand
above the timbers to the west, it might be more pleasant to continue down
the boardwalk to the north.

Boardwalk~
Fishermen take advantage of the boardwalk almost as much as they take

line, or a net in hopes of bringing in {Bf{Ci{Bsh{w.  The boardwalk is comprised of
heavy timbers, held together with pitch and firmly anchored a hand below
Dock Road to the west.

the {Bf{Ci{Bshm{Ca{Brk{Ce{Bt{w somewhat north of here.  Along the north-south flowing Dock
Road are several buildings, one such building to the west seems to be of
great interest to some of the people walking down the street.

the only dock in Aringill that extends outward into the Erinnin for more
than a span.  Almost any time of day it can be found crowded with people
earning a living, or those just looking for some relaxation.  The dock

grab a morsel, then fly upwards again with a trail of other {Wgulls{w, too
intent on stealing the first {Wgull{w'{Ws{w food to notice the other crumbs
scattered across the dock.

Boardwalk~
This is the portion of the boardwalk that butts up against one of the
piers, called South Pier, to differentiate it from Kepler's Pier.  It
travels south away from the dock out towards the {ymudflats{w.  People walking
onto the boardwalk from Dock Road to the west have to step down onto the
{ytimbers{w about a hand, as the boardwalk is somewhat sunken from the level of
the road.  The people walking along this portion of the boardwalk seem to be
in a hurry for some reason.

Dock Road~
A decidedly {Bf{Ci{Bshy{w smell wafts from the {Bf{Ci{Bshm{Ca{Brk{Ce{Bt{w to the west and pours
out over Dock Road.  The locals, however, do not seem to either mind, or
notice the odor, though it is obvious they are very much aware of the
presence of the {Bf{Ci{Bshm{Ca{Brk{Ce{Bt{w itself.  Fishermen, locals, merchants, and
sailors alike can be seen steering over towards the low building.

Dock Road~
The scent of {Drotten {Bf{Ci{Bsh{w, is very strong along this portion of Dock Road.
The most likely culprit is the low building along its western edge, a
{Bf{Ci{Bshm{Ca{Brk{Ce{Bt{w.  Most people walking down the road don't seem to notice the
stench, but those that do, skirt away from the building, moving out to the
east to walk along the boardwalk, or hustling to quickly pass this section
of road to continue on to the north or the south.

South Pier~
South Pier is the smaller of the two main piers in Aringill.  Right here,
at the beginning of South Pier, you can easily walk from the {ytimbers{w of the
pier onto the {ytimbers{w of the boardwalk to the south.  Laborers and sailors
can be seen moving from the small ships moored here to Dock Road to the
west.  Here and there an outlander merchant can be spotted striking up a
conversation with a prospective buyer for his or her cargo.  South Pier is
dotted with small, rivercraft further to the east.

South Pier~
Small craft are tied down with sturdy lines (a sailor's term for rope),
along both the north and south of the pier.  Sailors, with their distinctive
walk, try to keep their balance on surfaces that do no move.  Taking a look
at the sailors, it is easy to see that some of that are outlanders, their
skin tone, their hair coloring, even the types of hats they wear to create a
small bit of {Dshade{w from the {Ysun{w overhead, adds to their distinctiveness from
the local Andorans.  The pier continues to the east and west, toward the
center of the Erinnin, and the shore along Aringill.

Sailors and laborers can be found in large numbers on Dock Road near the
actual piers.  South Pier, the smaller of the two main piers in Aringill is
just off to the east.  While weaving between the people you get a glimpse of
the Erinnin, the {criver{w which seperates Andor from Cairhien, Aringill from
Maerone.  Travel along Dock Road continues both to the north and to the
south.

Dock Road~
As you journey along Dock Road you notice a well-populated building, on
the west side of the street, opposite the Erinnin.  Locals dressed in
functional, workers' clothing mill around it.  Middle-aged outlanders with
the look of a strong will are also found entering the building, and often
leaving the building with a string of somewhere around five of the locals. 
Maybe the building is a recruiting station of some sort.  From here you can
travel along Dock Road to the North toward Kepler's Pier, or in the opposite
direction to South Pier.

Dock Road~
Bare-chested, and often bare-footed sailors are found along Dock Road
hanging closely around either of the two major piers.  Unlike what would be
expected of sailors by reputation, these men hanging around the piers do not
appear to be carousing or inebriated.  Kepler's Pier, the largest of the two
important piers is a short ways northwards down Dock Road.  The smaller,
South Pier, is not far in the opposite direction.

Dock Road~
You have come to a portion of Dock Road that connects up with Kepler's
Pier.  The city's largest pier, Kepler's is just to the east.  Several large
boats are moored alongside it.  The area directly to the west is relatively
flat, A perfect spot for runaway barrels and wagons to park for a few
moments out from underneath the feet of the many people traveling along Dock

Large trading vessels usually inhabit this large pier, reserving South
Pier for smaller craft or pleasure vessels, and even passenger ships.  Not
every spot that could hold a ship has one moored, making sure that there is
room for the vessels to maneauver.  The {criver{w is unusually deep right along
the bank here, as there is a steep dropoff.  Be careful not to fall into the
{cwater{w.

Sailors and dockworkers scrabble to get out of the way as one ship is
using a boom to load prized Andoran livestock into its hold.  The animals
being loaded are mostly a few heads of {yc{Wa{yttl{We{w, and a couple of {Wsheep{w. 
Somehow, you get the impression that these animals are not being transported
to be slaughtered, but as breeding stock.

against the pillars of the pier itself.  On the north-side of the pier some
{yplanks{w has been extended to allow easier access onto the large boat docked
there.  Laborers and sailors alike are kept busy with the many tasks that
need to be performed before pulling {Danchor{w.

Kepler's Pier, makes it feasible to really see any activity on the
Cairhienin side of the Erinnin.  Today, on the other side of the {criver{w, a
large trading vessel has pulled in.  Small figures, like so many {Dants{w in the

docks, and bits of shoreline following the {criver's{w contour.  Laborers watch
their footing as the haul goods between the warehouses and the ships or the
inverse.  They must weave between the merchants crowding the road and the
sailors getting ready to carouse about the town or heading back to their
duties before untying lines and pushing off once again.

the goods taken inside and those that are retrieved by laborers, marking off

You are on the deck of the {RWild Mistress{w, a trading vessel with a Tairen

barrels and readying them to be taken off of the ship by means of a few
{yplanks{w stretched between the deck and Kepler's Pier to the south.  Barely
sparing you a glance they look over their shoulders and point with their
chins towards the cargohold, likely thinking you are here to help them

The Center Beam of the Wild Mistress~
The {RWild Mistress{w is a sleek cargo craft from down {criver{w, homeported in
Tear.  You are standing mid-ship, or equidistant from either side, called
port and starboard (left and right) from the front (bow).  Snake-like coils
of {yrope{w (line) are flaked out on the deck in such a manner that it would be
difficult to cause it to tangle.  Befouled lines take time to untangle and
is costly in both manpower and time, and dangerous to boot.  A double-wide
hatch is set into the floor, much like the doors that give access to a
cellar.  The hatch must lead to the cargohold.

Keeping your balance as you stand on the deck of the {RWild Mistress{w is not
difficult; however, it is a true test of a sailor to stay balanced when it
is sailing down the river and a full-force gale whips the mast about and
sends the {Wsails{w into a state of constant change.  A couple of crewmen swab
the deck in a desultory manor, it is not hard to read in their expressions a
desire to carouse about the city instead of working.  Their swabs run back
and forth over the same {yplanks{w while their attention is riveted to the west.
Though their attention is rather lapse, they are constantly aware of where
the open hatch is and do not get too close to it.

The Port Side of the Wild Mistress~
You are standing on the deck on the portside of the {RWild Mistress{w.  Just
over the railing you can look down and see the {cwater{w of the {criver{w churn with
the slight rocking of the vessel.  Laborers on Kepler's Pier take no heed of
your scrutiny though the crewmen of the {RWild Mistress{w do.  They try to get
your attention and point you toward tasks that need to be done.  They
obviously think you are hired labor.  Toward the centerbeam there seems to
be a bit more going on and you can more easily escape the scrutiny of the
{RWild Mistress'{w crewmen.  West, toward the bow, you will find the {yplank{w that
will bring you back to the relative stability of Kepler's Pier.

The Starboard Side of the Wild Mistress~
As you stand on the starboard side of the {RWild Mistress{w and look out over
the expanse of the {criver{w you can't help but to think about the great
distances that this boat must travel each year.  You might get up the
gumption to ask one of the crewmen if the boat runs solely between Tear and
Andor, or if the {RWild Mistress{w can handle the open {Csea{w and travel to even
more exotic places: Illian, Tarabon, Arad Doman.

The Starboard Side of the Wild Mistress~
As you walk along the starboard side of the {RWild Mistress{w, you notice that
there are a few crewmen checking the water-logged {ylines{w that snake out all
over this portion of the deck.  With a hefty jerk, one of the crewmen
handles one of the {ylines{w that narrowly misses tripping you.  With a grumble,
the crewman motions you away, threatening your equiliberium with another
jerk of the {yline{w.  He seems to get the point across that under no
circumstances does he want you near his work.

The Starboard Cargohold~
The cargohold has no portholes.  The only light that illuminates the hold
come from the gimbaled {Doil{w {Yl{ya{Ymps{w, which are currently unlit, and what you
have brought in.  On occassion, when the main cargohold hatch is open some
light filters through but not much.  The hold looks fairly empty save for
one tightly sealed cask and a small {ywooden{w box sitting on top of it.

The port cargohold is also fairly empty, and even more dimly lit, as it
does not have the benefit of a hatch where light can seep through the
cracks.  Gimbaled {Doil{w {Yl{ya{Ymps{w sway without spilling their contents as the {RWild
Mistress{w rocks with the gentle motion of an anchored craft.  Aromatic spices
permeate the hull giving a slight hint of what was carried in this hold
either on this trip or one in the not so distant past.

Crew Berthing~
Although the berthing area is no more than a span tall, bunks line the
bulkheads four high, leaving little room to move about or even to rest
comfortably.  At the foot of each stack of bunks is a {yladder{w to help the
crewmen to clammor into their small cubby of space.  At the head of each
bunk is an enclosed shelf for each sailor's personal affects.  Clothing is
stored in a communal, tall, stacked, chest-of-drawers.  Sailors along the
starboard bulkhead get the coveted privilage of each having their own
personal {Cporthole{w.  A couple of the {Cportholes{w are covered with make-shift
curtains.  These are fashioned out of rags or worn clothing to keep out the
light of the {Ysun{w.

Galley~
{DPots{w, spoons, spatulas, tongs, and other implements can be found swaying
on deeply curved hooks.  Each of these items can cause a serious {Rac{Wc{ri{Wde{Rnt{w,
if not a mortal wound, if not properly stowed.  Along one bulkhead is a
barrel strapped with {yb{Yr{ra{yss{w bands, after lifting its lid you can see it
contains sacks of various types of dried beans, and {gpe{Ga{gs{w.  Cured {Mhams{w sway
above the barrel on short ropes attached to yet more hooks.  There are no
tables, benches, or chairs in here, likely the sailors grab up a plate and
eat their meals elsewhere.  A hatch in the deck furthest from the food and
closest to the door leads down to the next level.

scrape your hand across the bulkheads and inspect them closely, you will
feel the fine-grained, smooth, finish of the wood, and will find little
trace of actual {Dd{yi{Dr{yt{w.  The color is a patina of long usage.  Many-a-washrag
has been put to use along the bulkheads and in the process, stains and oils
have become embedded in them.  The {mcloying{w odor of some cheap and heavy
{mpe{rr{mfu{rm{me{w -almost- covers the unpleasant odors of everything else in this
compartment.  The single ladder leads back up the hatch and out of the

First Mate's Berthing~
A small cramped compartment, serves as the sleeping place for the First
Mate.  However small this room may appear to be to land lubbers, it is many
notches above what a normal crewman is given.  With the added privacy and
personal space comes added responsibilities, and sheltering the Captain from
the frivolities of crewmen's perceived needs is one of those
responsibilities.  The head of a small bunk rests alongside the ladder
heading up, and opposite of the bunk and ladder is the Captain's berthing.

Captain's Berthing~
The Captain of the {RWild Mistress{w has a few well earned luxuries, a
berthing compartment all of his own being near the top of that list.  On a
vessel, no matter the size, space is at a premium.  Privacy is also near the
top of that list and the Captain gets to enjoy both to some degree.  This
berthing space is buffered from crewmen with questions, complaints, or
problems by the First Mate whose berthing is to port of this compartment.  A
single bunk with a small but comfortable mattress takes up the majority of
this berthing space.  A chest, as long as the length of a man's arm sits at
its foot.  A pair of ornately carved bookends sitting on top of the chest,
adds a small touch of home to the enclosed area.

by the tiniest increments to conform to specifications and to help with

odd hours, though to facilitate the boats to the piers, a latched gate is

you catch a {Wflash{w of movement and realize it is the fishermen who are

Well-packed {ydirt{w, is found in this less trafficked area.  Though the area

the broad hard-packed {ydirt{w path of the alley.  The alley meanders slightly
but doggedly continues in a north-south direction despite the ocassional
boulder or caked, dried, pit of mud that defines the direction of the path.

The {ydirt{w-caked alley is flanked on either side by knee-high or larger
weeds and tall grasses.  Several different varieties of {Ywi{yl{Ydf{Wlo{Mwe{Grs{w are seen
between the tall stems.  The path is fairly large, with old wheel-ruts
etched into what once was mud.  In general, the path makes a clear swath,
only slightly obscured by weeds in a north-south direction.

The weed-choked alley cuts through debris north-south along the
western-most edge of a clearing.  Sweetish-rotting smells drift toward the
path from the east where the clearing is defined.  Irregular humps are seen
in the clearing, some covered over with {yearth{w others with weeds and {ggras{Gs{ges{w
and still others seem to be nothing more than heaps of trash.

Piles of rubbish are strewn about the clearing.  This must be a central

The furtherest piles, the ones furtherest to the east are covered over with
{gfol{Gi{gage{w.  Nearest the path to the west the piles are the most pungent and
uncovered by any means, while those inbetween are covered only by a thin
layer of {ysoil{w.

A wide, {ydirt{w path cuts through and bends around the edge of what seems to
be a clearing with several rubbish piles.  A sweetish-rotting smell drifts
in when the breeze blows just right.  The path itself curves toward the west
and to the south skirting the majority of the trash.

It is in this clearing that trash, both kitchen-type and household find
their way to a resting place.  This area positively reeks with piles of

Eastwards, the stench of a trash dumping site, might make you consider to
take the other route to the north on the trail away from its unpleasant
odor.  The path looks fairly used, and the {ggras{Gs{w beaten back to the edges
leaving a mostly clear area, about wide enough for two people to walk
abreast if they are not very large.

This portion of North Road seems to be realitively quiet.  It is as if
the hustle and bustle of the port city has not reached its arms out to
embrace this portion of Aringill.  The small shops on either side of the
road are not entirely without influence from the Erinnin, as one shop sells
{Wsailcloth{w and another perfumes from across the Aiel Waste.

For such a broad thoroughfare, traffic seems to be very thin.  This

it does not look like many sailors make their way here.  The street is
clean, free from debris, and continues both north and south.

It is a small, sturdy building, with a handsomely tiled roof.  Across the
street from the {Ymoney{w-changer's is a small stone building with no {cwindows{w. 
It may be an outdoor strongroom for valuables, or another warehouse with
valuable goods.  Other buildings along the roadway show that this section of
North Road seems to be exclusively dealing with high-end merchandise for
trade.  There is little evidence of residental dweillings.

Low buildings with gently sloping roofs line either side of North Road;
which true to its name does indeed seem to be heading north-south.  Several
affluent-looking villagers take notice of you as you take notice of them as
you travel along the thoroughfare.  The street is swept clean showing you
the fine texture of the compact paving stones, which seem to somehow have
been glued together to make a single sheet of rock.  Andoran Way is a short
journey to the south from here.

{Ywealthy{w.  Here, as with almost everywhere you may travel, villagers keep
their purses close and it is hard to hear even a faint jingling of coin. 
Peaked hats seem to be the current fashion.  They are found on the
affluent-looking villagers, men and women alike, though the women tend to
favor {Mf{Wl{Yo{Gr{Wa{Ml{w patterns and men {Bs{bt{mr{bi{Bp{be{ms{w or {bsolids{w.

The paving stones along North Road are unlike most any road you have
seen.  It seems to be made of a composite of many smaller bits of gravel,
somehow glued together to appear to be one solid sheet of rock.  Even in the
hot {Ysun{w of the {Gsum{Ym{Ger{w no sign of glue falling apart can be witnessed.  If
you take the time to pry up one of the small bits of gravel it leaves behind
a depression of {Dg{wra{Dy{w sand that is almost as hard as rock.  It must be a most
expensive sort of new mortar.

Fashionably dressed villagers can be seen strolling the streets, and with
them, members of Aringill's constabulary, making sure that these people are
not accosted in broad {Ydayl{Wi{Yght{w.

them on a regular basis.  One {Wwhitew{wa{Ws{wh{We{wd building sitting off on the west
side of the street seems to stand out from the {rbrick{w buildings and those
with painted siding.  A sign depicting a goblet three-quarters full of a {Rred{w

"Coming soon North Road extension and Inn of the Silver Crescent."

You are standing just south of the Inn of the Silver Crescent on North
Road.  The sounds of a merry tune, played on a flute, accompanied by
clapping can be heard.  If you listen closely you think you can just make
out the tune as being: {DA {GF{gr{Gog {Don the {CIce{w.  Roaring laughter is heard after
the tune finishes.  As you look to either side of the road you can see short
one and two-storied buildings, the inn included.  A small alley snakes
behind the inn to the east.  If you head south for a long stretch you will
eventually run into Andoran Way.

The road is little more than a two-lane {ydirt track{x, allowing large {Dw{yagon{Ds{x
and {yc{wa{Dr{wt{ys{x to enter and leave a nearby work camp.  Along the western side of
the road is a trench although the sides of which are shallow enough to
traverse in safety at this point.  To the south is an intersection that
links this temporary {ydirt track{x with a more permanent thoroughfare leading
through the town.

the sights of passersby while the airy feel to the room is enhanced by the
drapings of {Wl{wa{Wc{we that is found on an endtable and against a bookshelf, and
almost everywhere else imaginable.  The whole room smells like a fresh load
of {Wlaundry{w.  Open archways lead further into this establishment and a {Yp{yi{Yne{w
stairway heads upward.

The Back of the Grand Wickergarden Retreat~
A strong breeze makes the diaphanous linen curtains hanging over the open
bay doors to the west billow inward.  Birdsong and fresh air brings its own
invigorating vitality to add to the teas you might be sampling in here. 
{CMoon{cl{wi{cght{w, and {Re{yv{Re{Yn{Ri{rng {Ysun{w can stream in from the open doors through the
curtains, creating an eerie, but peaceful effect.  Open archways lead to
other rooms in the Grand Wickergarden Retreat.  A narrow staircase leads
upward.

The Deck of the Grand Wickergarden Retreat~
This isn't so much a deck as it is a strategic location to enjoy the
outdoors in a relaxed manner.  Large pieces of {Dslate{w are splayed out in a
semi-circular pattern and the chairs are placed on top of each {Dslab{w.  In
between the chairs is a lush carpet of {Ggreen grass{w.  Outward from the chairs
is the view of the garden.

The Wickergarden~
Pine-smelling, ground-hugging, {gJun{ci{gpe{cr{g bushes{w flank the {ywic{Dk{yer{w chairs in
a slightly larger semi-circle than the chairs themselves.  Tall Perennial
{gg{Gr{gasses{w with feathery seed-heads are seen between flowering {Md{Wo{Mg{ywood{w trees. 
Though all of the plant-life has been trimmed and pruned and planted in
aesthetically pleasing arrangements it does not look too rigid, too
unnatural.  The garden continues to the north.

set out in a semi-circle.  This garden is groomed to give an elegant
presentation of nature.  {WPaperb{Di{yr{Wc{yh{w and thin-barked aspens have been
carefully pruned and kept parasite free.  Peeping between fronds of dark
curly {gferns{w are bright {ybrown-eyed {YS{yu{Ysa{yn{Ys{w and brilliant {Rred Ho{rl{Rlyhoc{rk{Rs{w on
slender stems.  The garden continues to the south.

An {givy{w motif follows the edging along the ceiling and above the
baseboards.  Trimming the edging on the ceiling, are hand-wide streamers of
{Wwhite{w and {Ggreen{w lace.  This might be a cozy place to stand and speak with
friends over a cup of tea, or you may prefer to stoll out toward the back
toward the garden.  If you wish a more private conversation the Rose Room,
upstairs may be more to your liking.

Wall-hangings, seat cushions, even the carpet is covered in a pattern of
{Mpink{w roses.  Dried, pressed {Mrosepetals{w are laid out between sheets of fine
vellum and hung in strips, slung between wall-hangings.  A vase containing a

The {Ymoney{w-changer's establishment seems rather cramped once you step
inside.  It isn't so much that there is very little room to maneuver, but
rather that there are many guards working for the {Ymoney{w-changer.  There are
a few pieces of decor: an expensive-looking plant, a painting, a table with
small boxes of {Rl{ra{Dqu{re{Dr{rw{Ra{Dr{re{w.  But it is the woman behind the desk that people
have come to see when they enter this building.

many logs, mostly green and unseasoned, split into managable pieces.  The
other half, along with a particulary gnarled stump are the objects holding
the attention of a burly axe-wielding man.

Workcamp Entrance~
The {Bbr{Ril{Wl{Yia{Gnt{x banners can be seen back to the east and south of here. 
Working ones way into the workcamp is a bit difficult, but with patience it
can be done.  {yM{ru{yd{x bricks can be seen in piles all around.  A cart actually
lies off to the side, waiting to be hitched to one of the {yox{We{yn{x.

Center Square of the Workcamp~
This seems to be very close to the center of activity.  A stack of single
mud-bricks reaches up to the sky, creating the looks of a tall slim tower. 
At the top of the slim tower there is a short pole, attached to the pole is
an abundance of {Gvi{Wv{Gid{x {Ggr{ge{Gen{x {Gb{Wa{Gnne{Wr{Gs{x.

West Side of the Workcamp~
Here on the far west edge of the workcamp there seems to have been an
accident involving two half-filled carts.  One cart seems to have been laden
with damp earth, the other with a trough-like, hollowed out log that had
held {cwater{w.  The resultant {ymud{w has made a short man with a clipboard
furious.

The Workcamp~
This work camp lies close to the center of Aringill.  It is a huge area
of muddy land that is surrounded by workshops, log cabins and partially
built brickwork structures.  The land has been scored with a network of
paths made by the wagons and animals used to haul building materials through
the camp.  Strangely the south and eastern edges of the work camp have no
buildings, instead a deep ditch marks the southern perimeter and a high dirt
wall marks the eastern border of the work camp.

This section of the work camp lies just north of the camp's main entrance
and provides a good vantage point to view the people, animals and carts
entering and leaving the site.  The camp itself stretches out in all
directions apart from eastwards where a high dirt wall has been built around
the camp's perimeter, effectively barring the way ahead.

The Overseer's Hut~
The Overseer's hut is a large cabin constructed from roughly hewn logs. 
Despite its {Ds{wp{Dar{ws{De{x looks, the building is warm, dry and more than sufficient
for its needs.  A mezzanine level fenced off by a {ywo{Do{yden rail{Di{yng{x has been
built overlooking the hut's entrance, the only route to access this upper
level is a {ynar{Dro{yw stair{Dc{yase{x along the southern wall.  There are several
doorways leading off from this room but none have any markings to say what
lies behind each of them.

It is more functional than homely with rows of neatly made {yb{Du{ynk be{Dd{ys{x lining

{Dl{yo{wcke{yr{Ds{x lining the north wall of the dormitory.

Partially constructed buildings form a neat line along the work camp's
northern perimeter, their timber frames and brickwork shells are void of any
other features such as doors or window frames.  Thick poles of bamboo lashed
tightly together forms a scaffold around each unfinished building; the
buildings' large sizes suggest that they will eventually become warehouses.

Piled high on either edge of the road are mounds of hardpacked {yearth{w. 
They form twin walls to both the north and south making a sort of a tunnel. 
Congestion is a rampant problem as laborers and drivers vie for the
privilege of either entering or leaving the workcamp.  Archer's Way is to
the east and the workcamp itself is to the west.

and produce {Rf{Yr{Ruit{x annually.  There are also rows of {gc{yr{Go{Yp{gs{x that are carefully
tended and watered to not only feed the family, but to sell at market.  To

has been roped off but probably leads to the guest rooms.

the skillful hands of the members of the thieves guild.

Where the Seweres Join~
The three sewer tunnels meet here at this junction, the stone of the
sewers absorbs the cold of the earth and keeps the area just around
freezing.  The ground is covered with the murky contents of the sewers that
sometimes overflows and settles here, giving off a nasty, stagnant stench. 
Just to the east is a large stone door that looks fairly heavy and difficult
to open unless one has the proper key.

Common Area~
The stagnant stench of the sewers lingers on the air in this area which
has been built with hard wood.  Fancy couches and chairs along with plainer
more comfortable sitting arrangements are situated around the room in a half
hazard style, as if those who occupy it move them wherever they like.  There
are gaming tables in the room and a long, rectangular table has been pushed
in one corner of the room, two long benches beneath it.  Men and women
linger around the room, some dressed in rags, others in much finer clothes.

Hanging from the ceiling is a rather magnificent chandelier, dozens of

mismatched chairs surrounding it.  Set in the center of the table is a
pitcher and matching crytal glasses along with some finger foods.  Resting
on a small table in one of the corners is a green, shiny plant with pink
flowers, next to it is a stick of burning incense .

The room is dimly lit and there is a large gathering of men and women in

fighting comes from the center of the circle.  Feathers float in the air as
two rather large roosters try their best at killing each other, using their
feet to claw each other along the breast and the beaks to peck each others
eyes out.

with two or three large, vicious appearing dogs inside.  Some of the dogs
are laying quietly, resting, others are eagerly awaiting their next meal. 
Even though there are many animals in here, the room is kept clean of their
mess, keeping the stench to a minimum, and the animals healthy.

Bathing Room~
The air in the bathing room is hot and slightly sticky, a soft aroma of
incense burning.  The floor in this room hasn't been covered with wood,
instead it's the same stone of the sewer system.  Three copper tubs have
been set up in the room, each one just a few feet from the other.  Setting
beside each tub is a three-legged stool with a folded towel and bar of soap
resting on top.  In the north eastern corner of the room is a water tap,
hooked to the city's central line and in the southern part of the room is a
large fireplace where kettles are hung to heat the water for the tubs.

that rest in this room are here to guard.  All of the men eye each other
wearily, some sit on the bench pretending to rest, others busy themselves
sharpening their weapons or pounding dents out of their mismatched armor. 
No matter what these men are doing, they don't seem like the type to bother,
tread carefully.

with straw.  Laid along the floor on the eastern side of the room are thick
mats on which several men and women practice what looks to be something
similar to martial arts.  To the southern part of the room are some chairs,
some are sat in, others empty, members of the guild practice their skills of
thievery by attempting to swipe items off the others without notice.

Treasury~
A few lanterns have been set on small tables scattered throughout this
room.  Lined in the center of the room are several large metal {Dc{wh{Wes{wt{Ds{x, most
of them open and coins, {yg{Yo{yld{x and {Ds{wi{Wlv{we{Dr{x, are piled high, spilling over to
the floor around the chests.  Mixed in with the coins are many {rg{Re{rms{x and
{gj{Ge{gw{Ge{gls{x, Sea Folk {cp{Co{crc{Ce{cl{Cai{cn{x, and other types of worldly treasures.

Hallway~
The wood creaks beneath the feet of any who move across it in this
darkened hallway.  Standing in one corner is a tall statue of gold in the
shape of a naked woman, her arms raised over head, face raised and eyes
closed.  A bright blue rug covers the floor and a silk tapestry depicting
the current Panarch of Tarabon, Amathera Aelfdene Casmir Lounault, standing
before the Panarch's Palace.  There is a door to the east and another one to
the south.

Guild Master's Office~
Dark walnut panels have been fixed to the walls in this cozy little
office.  Resting in the center of the room is a medium-sized desk of a
simple dark wood, the top shiny and smooth.  Various stacks of papers, and
ink well and several well-kept quills rest atop the desk, along with an
obsidian statue of an attacking bear.  A high-backed chair with leather
cushions is pushed in behind the desk and across from it are two matching
low-backed chairs.  Lining the northern wall is a long bookcase partially
filled with books and other treasures the thief master has collected. 
Spread over the floor in front of the book case is a thick white fur rug
with black stripes.

Master Thief Bedroom~
The floor is covered completely with a deep {yg{Yo{yld r{Yu{yg{x, the pile thick and
lush.  Pushed against the north wall is a king-sized four poster bed, the
thick mattress is covered with a deep purple comforter, small round and
square pillows edged in gold piled on top.  On each side of the bed is a
simple, oak table, a few personal items resting atop them.  Built into the
south wall is a large, brick {Df{rir{Repl{rac{De{x, odd in this building beneath the
ground, but oddly no smoke escapes into the room.  A black iron lattice
grate rests in front of the flames, ensuring that none escape into the room.
In front of the fireplace a rather large black {Dw{Wo{Dlf f{Wu{Dr{x has been spread out.
Hanging on the walls are two tapestries made of the finest silk threads.

Bathing Room~
The floor has been covered in tiny square {Wt{Ci{Wles{x, each one shiny and
smooth, in the center of the floor is a large drain that leads to the sewers
beneath the floor.  A large {Wivory tub{x, each of the four legs that hold the
tub up carved in the shape of a lion's claw.  A small white cabinet next to
the tub has various bottles of {Ys{Woa{Yps{x to be used in the tub and shampoos.  A
tall, red {Rv{ra{Rse{x rests atop the table with two long stemmed {Wwhite{x roses in
full bloom standing inside.  Two golden hooks in the shape of a curved
dagger hold soft, {Bblue{x towels.  Several iron brazier's have been placed
around the room, each filled with red-hot coals, giving off heat to keep the
room warm.

Guard Room~
A small table rests in the center of an equally small room, two chairs
beside it.  A brass lantern hangs above the table, giving off just enough
light for the guards to play a game of cards or read while they take their
turn watching the cells.  The doors to the north and east lead into dark
cells, the door are made of thick metal and have long black metal clasps
that close and are padlocked.  The door to the south leads to the torture
chamber.

Holding Cell~
The cell is dark and musty, the air heavy and difficult to breath.  The
stone walls are cold and have a moist feel, adding to the chill in the
small, enclosed cell.  The door is one-foot thick iron with only a six-inch
square window, iron bars every one-inch vertical make it impossible for any
escape there.  A single, worn cot is set up against the west wall, an
equally worn blanket thrown on top.

Torture Chamber~
The room is rather large though a bit crowded with all the implements
that are used within this room.  The walls are cold {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x, moisture in cool
beads slide slowly along their lengths.  Hanging from the wall on the east
side of the room are many hooks, each holding up various torture implements,
whips, cat'o'nine tails, clamps with sharp teeth, and other scary looking
objects.  A strange table sets near the south wall, at each corner a {yr{Yo{ype{x
and {Dp{wu{Dll{we{Dy{x has been set up, obviously to pull on something.  In the center
of the room is a high-back wooden chair with arms, there are {Dl{rea{Dth{re{Dr{x straps
at the arms, legs, and against the back of the chair.  A metal table has
been set up next to the chair, atop it are various sharp implements, {rbl{Roo{rdy{x
from previous use.  A very large brazier full of {rh{Ro{rt {Dc{Roa{Dls{x, big enough to
put a foot in, rests in front of the chair, several long handled pokers
shoved deep inside.  In one corner of the room is an old iron {Dm{rai{Dd{re{Dn{x, used
as the last resort.  Two sets of manacles are set high into the western
wall.

Inside The Sewers~
{DDark gr{We{Dy bricks have been mortared tightly together along the walls of
the sewer system that runs through the city, thick planks of wood and dirt
make the ceiling above and the floor beneath is a muddy mess except for the
rare large rock or dry spot that may be found.  Thick pipes run through the
sewers, up along the walls leading up to the houses and businesses, others
along the ground.  The air is heavy and dank, a strong putrid stench hanging
in the area.  The lighting is very dim, there being no natural light source
here beneath the ground, the sc{yu{Drry{yi{Dng feel of something running across the

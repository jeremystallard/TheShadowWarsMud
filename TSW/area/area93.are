~
If a close look is taken on this young man, Andoran features can be
noticed.  His once blond hair is dark brown from dirt, reaching below his
shoulders which he keeps hunched.  His clothes than once could have titled
him a Lord, are now nothing but dirty rags.  As he turns to look at you, you
can see little sanity in his blood-shot blue eyes.

A dark-haired man with pale skin~
A dark-haired man with pale skin and piercing eyes is here.
~
There is something strange about this man..  Perhaps it is the total
control that he has over his body..  Perhaps it is how fast he moves in
certain situations..  Whatever it is, it sets off alarm bells in your head. 

He has dark hair, with piercing grey eyes.  He is clothed all in black.

Twice dawns the day when his blood is shed.  Once for mourning, once for
birth.  Red on black, the Dragons blood stains the rocks of Shayol Ghul.  In
the Pit of Doom shall his blood free men from the Shadow.  

His blood on the rocks of Shayol Ghul, washing away the Shadow, sacrifice
for man's salvation.  

There can be no health in us, nor any good thing grow, for the land is one
with the Dragon Reborn, and he one with the land.  Soul of fire, heart of
stone, in pride he conquers, forcing the proud to yield.  He calls upon the
mountains to kneel, and the seas to give way, and the very skies to bow. 
Pray that the heart of stone remembers tears, and the soul of fire, love.  
~
E
page3~
With his coming are the dread fires born again.  The hills burn, and the
land turns sere.  The tides of men run out, and the hours dwindle.  The wall
is pierced, and the veil of parting raised.  Storms rumble beyond the
horizon, and the fires of heaven purge the earth.  There is no salvation
without destruction, no hope this side of death. ; 

The seals that hold back night shall weaken, and in the heart of winter
shall winter's heart be born amid the wailing of lamentations and the
gnashing of teeth, for winter's heart shall ride a black horse, and the name
of it is Death.  

Power of the Shadow made human flesh, wakened to turmoil and strife and
ruin.  The Reborn One, marked and bleeding, danced the sword in dreams and
mist, chains the Shadowsworn to his will, from the city, lost and forsaken,
leads the spears to war once more, breaks the spears and makes them see,
truth long hidden in the ancient dream.  

As the plow breaks the earth shall he break the lives of men, and all that
was shall be consumed in the fire of his eyes.  The trumpets of was shall he
sound at his footsteps, the raven feed at his voice, and he shall wear a
crown of swords.  

The north shall he tie to the east, and the west shall be bound to the
south.  

Into the heart he thrusts his sword, into the heart, to hold their hearts. 
Who draws it out shall follow after.  What hand can grasp that fearful
blade?  

The unstained tower breaks and bends knee to the forgotten sign.  The seas
rage, and stormclouds gather unseen.  Beyond the horizon, hidden fires
swell, and serpents nestle in the bosom.  What was exalted in cast down; and
what was cast down is raised up.  Order burns to clear his path.  
~
E
page2~
Twice and twice shall he be marked, 
twice to live, and twice to die. 
Once the heron, to set his path.
Twice the heron to name him true.
Once the Dragon for remembrance lost.
Twice the Dragon, for the price he must pay. 
 
For he shall come like the breaking dawn, and shatter the world 
again with his coming, and make it anew.
 
~
E
page1~
And it shall come to pass that what men made shall be shattered and the
Shadow shall lie across the Pattern of the Age, and the Dark one shall once
more lay his hand upon the world of man.  Women shall weep and men quail as
the nations of the earth are rent like rotting cloth.  Neither shall
anything stand nor abide...  Yet one shall be born to face the Shadow, born
once more as he was born before and shall be born again, time without end. 
The Dragon shall be Reborn, and there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth
at his rebirth.  In sackcloth and ashes shall he clothe the people, and he
shall break the world again by his coming, tearing apart all ties that bind.
Like the unfettered dawn shall he blind us, and burn us, yet shall the
Dragon Reborn confront the Shadow at the Last Battle, and his blood shall
give us the Light.  Let tears flow, O ye people of the world.  Weep for your
salvation.  

On the slopes of Dragonmount shall he be born, born of a maiden wedded to no
man.  

The Shadow shall rise across the world, and darken every land, even to the
smallest corner, and there shall be neither Light nor safety.  And he who
shall be born of the Dawn, born of the Maiden, according to Prophecy, he
shall stretch forth his hand to catch the Shadow, and the world shall scream
in pain of salvation.  All Glory be to the Creator, and to the Light, and to
he who shall be born again.  May the Light save us from him.  

He will be of the ancient blood, and raised by the old blood. ; 

And his paths shall be many, and who shall know his name, for he shall be
born among us many times, in many guises, as he has been and ever will be,
time without end.  His coming shall be like the sharp edge of the plow,
turning our lives in furrows from out of the plaves where we lie in our
silence.  The breaker of bonds; the forger of chains.  The maker of futures;
the unshaper of destiny.

Power of the Shadow made human flesh,
wakened to turmoil, strife, and ruin.
The Reborn One, marked and bleeding,
dances the sword in dreams and mist,
chains the Shadowsworn to his will,
from the city, lost and forsaken,
leads the spears to war once more,
breaks the spears and makes them see,
truth long hidden in the ancient dream.
 
The unstained tower breaks and bends knee to the forgotten sign
The seas rage, and stormclouds gather unseen.
Beyond the horizon, hidden fires swell, and serpents nestle in the bosom.
What was exacted is cast down; what was cast down is raised up
Order burns to clear his path.
 
The seals that hold back night shall weaken,
and in the heart of winter shall winter's heart be born
amid the wailing of lamentations and the gnashing of teeth,
for winter's heart shall ride a black horse,
and the name of it is Death.

page3~
He shall slay his people with the sword of peace, and destroy them with
the leaf.  He shall bind the nine moons to serve him.  He shall heal wounds
of madness and cutting of hope.  

The Shadow shall rise across the world, and darken every land, even to the
smallest corner, and there shall be neither Light nor safety.  And he who
shall be born of the Dawn, born if the Maiden, according to Prophecy, he
shall stretch forth his hands to catch the Shadow, and the world shall
scream in the pain of salvation.  All Glory be to the Creator, and to the
Light, and to he who shall be born again.  May the Light save us from him 
 
Into the heart he thrusts his sword,
into the heart, to hold their hearts.
Who draws it out shall follow after,
What hand can grasp that fearful blade?

Twice and twice shall he be marked,
twice to live and twice to die.
Once the heron, to set his path.
Twice the heron, to name him true.
Once the Dragon, for remembrance lost.
Twice the Dragon, for the price he must pay
 
Twice dawns the day when his blood is shed.
Once for mourning, once for birth.
Red on black, the Dragon's blood stains the rock of Shayol Ghul
In the Pit of Doom shall his blood free men from the Shadow
 
The blood of the Dragon Reborn on the rocks of Shayol Ghul will
free mankind from the Shadow.

page1~
And it shall come to pass that what men made shall be shattered, and the
Shadow shall lie across the Pattern of the Age, and the Dark One shall once
more lay his hand upon the world of man.  Women shall weep and men quail as
the nations of the earth are rent like rotting cloth.  Neither shall
anything stand nor abide...  

Yet one shall be born to face the Shadow, born once more as he was born
before and shall be born again, time without end.  The Dragon shall be
Reborn, and there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth at his rebirth.  In
sackcloth and ashes shall he clothe the people, and he shall break the world
again by his coming, tearing apart all ties that bind.  Like the unfettered

the Shadow at the Last Battle, and his blood shall give us the Light.  Let
tears flow, O ye people of the world.  Weep for your salvation.  For he

coming, and make it anew

With his coming are the dread fires born again.  The hills burn, and the
land turns sere.  The tides of men run out, and the hours dwindle.  The wall
is pierced, and the veil of parting raised.  Storms rumble beyond the
horizon, and the fires of heaven purge the earth.  There is no salvation
without destruction, no hope this side of death.  

The unstained tower breaks and bends knee to the forgotten sign.  The seas
rage, and stormclouds gather unseen.  Beyond the horizon, hidden fires
swell, and serpents nestle in the bosom.  What was exalted is cast down;
what was cast down is raised up.  Order burns to clear his path.  

There can be no health in us, nor any good thing grow, for the land is one
with the Dragon Reborn, and he one with the land.  Soul of fire, heart of
stone, in pride he conquers, forcing the proud to yield.  He calls upon the
mountains to kneel, and the seas to give way, and the very skies to bow. 
Pray that the heart of stone remembers tears, and the soul of fire, love.  

The north shall he tie to the east, and the west shall be bound to the
south. ;; 

Master of the lightnings, rider on the storm, wearer of a crown of swords,
spinner-out of fate.  Who thinks he turns the Wheel of Time, may learn the
truth too late 
~

page3~
Power of the Shadow made human flesh
wakened to turmoil, strife and ruin
The Reborn One, marked and bleeding
dances the sword in dreams and mist
chains the Shadowsworn to his will
from the city, lost and forsaken
leads the spears to war once more,
breaks the spears and makes them see,
truth long hidden in the ancient dream.
 
Into the heart he thrusts his sword,
into the heart, to hold their hearts
Who draws it out shall follow after
What hand can grasp that fearful blade?
~
E
page2~
Twice and twice shall he be marked,
twice to live, and twice to die.
Once the heron to set his path
Twice the heron, to name him true.
Once the Dragon for remembrance lost.
Twice the Dragon for the price he must pay.
 
Twice dawns the day when his blood is shed.
Once for mourning, once for birth.
Red on black, the Dragon's blood stains the rock of Shayol Ghul.
In the Pit of Doom shall his blood free men from the Shadow.
 
And his paths shall be many, and who shall know his name, 
for he shall be born among us many times, in many guises, as 
he has been and ever will be, time without end. His coming shall 
be like the sharp edge of the plow, turning our lives in furrows 
from out of the places where we lie in our silence. The breaker
of bonds, the forger of chains. The maker of futures, the unshaper
of destiny.
~
E
page1~
And it shall come to pass that what men made shall be shattered, and the
Shadow shall lie across the Pattern of the Age, and the Dark One shall once
more lay his hand upon the world of man.  Women shall weep and men quail as
the nations of the earth are rent like rotting cloth.  Neither shall
anything stand nor abide...  

Yet one shall be born to face the Shadow, born once more as he was before
and shall be born again, time without end.  The Dragon shall be Reborn, and
there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth at his rebirth.  In sackcloth
and ashes shall he clothe the people, and he shall break the world again by
his coming, tearing apart all ties that bind.  Like the unfettered dawn
shall he blind us, and burn us, yet shall the Dragon Reborn confront the
Shadow at the Last Battle, and his blood shall give us the Light.  Let tears
flow, O ye people of the world.  Weep for your salvation.

east wall while {ysh{re{ylv{re{ys{x on the north wall hold many clean {Wwh{wi{Wte{x and {ybro{ww{Wn{wi{ysh
{Wr{wa{Wgs{x.  A strong smell comes from the weird {Wb{Co{Wt{Ct{Wl{Ce{Ws{x inside the open {yca{rb{yin{re{yt{x.

This room is at least fifty paces across, with {Wpol{wi{Wshed {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De {Wco{wlu{Wmns{x
supporting the wide open area.  {yG{Yolde{yn {Yl{ya{Ymp{ys{x are hung high from the ceiling
to keep the kitchen well-lit at all times.  On the west wall, a row of {Wcook
{Ds{rt{Rov{re{Ds{x and {Do{wv{Dens{x are placed, except for where the {ydoor{x leading to the {yP{Da{ynt{Dr{yy{x
is.  A long {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De {Wco{wu{Wnter{x can be seen on the south wall, holding many {cs{Ci{Wn{Ck{cs{x
for the {cw{Ca{ws{Wh{wi{Cn{cg{x up of {Wd{wi{Wshes{x.  A small opening with no door on the corner of
the south wall leads to the area where the {ySe{Yr{Dva{Yn{Yts{x have their meals.

The long {ym{Yapl{ye{x {ytable{x surrounded by matching {ychairs{x fills most of the
space in the {Wr{wo{Wom{x, leaving only a narrow space behind the seats to pass by.

This way obviously leads to parts of the {yS{Yt{Do{Yn{ye{x that no noble would ever
visit.  The walls are {Wb{wa{Wre{x even if clean, here and there a scroll that is
obviously not worth much coin.  The {yse{Yr{Dva{Yn{yts{x keep the {Wfloor t{Ci{wles{x and {yw{Do{yrn

Heart of the Stone - High Lord's Dining Room~
Entering the private dining chamber, you are amazed by the immensity and
beauty of this room.  Similar to other rooms in the {ys{Dt{wo{Dn{ye{x, the walls are
smooth {Dm{wa{Drb{wl{De{x, gilded with {yg{Yol{yd{x.  The ceiling in this room is a grid of
carved {ywo{Do{yden{x beams, again, gilded with {yg{Yol{yd{x.  Between the grids are murals
of {gfo{Gr{ye{Gs{gts{x and {Csk{Wi{Ces{x, almost real in their artistry.  There is a massive
{Dfi{wre{Wp{wla{Dce{x in this room as well, above which hangs another portrait of a man,
wearing a {rr{Re{rd{x robe and {yc{Yr{Wo{Yw{yn{x.  The walls are decorated with {Dt{wa{Wp{be{Bs{bt{Wr{wi{Des{x and
{Wstatues{x of the richest design.  And, upon the floor, sits a rug of the most
plush, handwoven {yg{Yol{yd{x.

Deeper in the Stone - Hallway~
Walking down this hall, one can see why the {yS{Yt{Do{Y{ye{x of Tear is notorious for
its many {yt{Yre{Wasu{Yre{ys{x.  Spanning to the east and west, the long hall is covered
with {gt{Gap{De{ws{Dtr{Gie{gs{x and {ypa{Wintin{ygs{x of various shapes and sizes, each priceless
and irreplaceable, making the hall into a museum of sorts.  From the west,
paneled {yo{Yak{x stretches to this portion of the hallway, fading ornately into
nothingness to blend with the wall around it.

Deeper in the Stone - Hallway~
The floors of this expansive hallway are remarkably clean, despite all of
the {ym{ru{yd{x that resides outside of this fortress.  Servants hurry in several
times a day to ensure that nothing is out of place before they can be seen
or any mess might be noticed.  They also ensure that the {Wcandle {Dw{wi{Dcks{x inside
each {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn {yl{Yan{Wt{Yer{yn{x are lit, keeping the hallway luminated so that it can be
traversed.

Carefully laid {Wm{wa{Wr{wb{Wl{we{x tiles, streaked with {yg{Yol{yd{x and {Ws{wi{Dlv{we{Dr{x, weave down
this wide hall.  Each square has been laid carefully as a puzzle piece
worked in to fit the whole.  Small {rr{Ra{Yi{C{Bb{Go{mw{Ws{x reflect off these shining tiles
when the light from {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn la{Yn{Wte{Yrn{ys{x hits them just right.  The solid {yg{Yol{yd{x
{yor{Yna{Wm{Yen{yts{x decorating the walls also accent the metal {yh{Yu{W{x in the tile work.

Moving Deeper Into the Stone~
The hallway straightens here, allowing you to view a long stretch to both
the north and the south.  Lined by brightly glowing {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn l{Yamp{ys{x, the hall
has a pleasant illumination that casts few {Dshadows{x.  Here and there, a
priceless {Ws{wt{Wa{wt{Wu{we{x stands regal and tall, carved from the finest {Wm{wa{Wr{wb{Wl{we{x, to
represent a prominent figure from Tairen history.  On either side of these
statues, there is a {Wv{Ya{Wse{x holding a beautiful assortment of {cf{Cl{Yo{Ww{Ye{Cr{cs{x. 
Symbolically, if the vase stands to the right of the statue, the resemblance
is still living.  Similarly, if the vase on the the left side, the person
has fulfilled his service in the name of the Light and passed on.

on very expensive {Wm{wa{Wr{wb{Wl{we {Wtiles{x that are laced with streaks of {yg{Yol{yd{x and

four people to sleep in without worry of elbowing or kicking each other and
the four {yposts{x are carved in {yv{Yi{ynes{x and what resembles a {Dcl{wo{Wu{wd{Dy{x {Ds{wk{Dy{x.  The

walls are only interrupted by the doorways into the High Lords quarters. 
While richly decorated, this is obviously still a fortress and the halls are
wide enough to allow for a small contingent of guards to hurry through
quickly.  A large {ywardrobe{x stands here against the wall holding arrows and
other supplies to be used in the event of a seige.

{yHi{rgh {yLo{rrd{x Anteroom~
This uncommonly large room is tastefully decorated in opulence and
luxury.  The colors are {rd{ya{Dr{r{xk and masculine, blending with the ornately
carved {ysu{rng{ywood{x moldings.  Upon the {rbu{Dr{ygu{rndy{x walls, {yg{Yol{yd{x leafed designs have
been carefully stamped to add a bright shimmer to the room.  A thick, woven
carpet of dark {ggreen{x and {yg{Yol{yd{x stretches across the entire floor, stopping
only a few inches short of the wall to expose carefully polished {ywo{ro{yden{x
floors.  Upon one wall, a very lavish {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x fireplace has been built, each
piece laid out carefully like a puzzle.  Upon the mantle sits a very large
{ypo{Wrtra{yit{x of the occupant of this room.

{yHi{rgh {yLo{rrd{x Bedroom~
The furnishings in this room are all made of a dark {yw{Do{ro{yd{x, very large and
ornately carved with winding vines.  They help to fill some of the overly
large space that is used as a living quarters.  Upon the floor, builders
have laid expensive {yha{Dr{rd{ywood{x that molds together at perfect joints.  Because
of the lack of windows, many large, decorative {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn{x scones cling to the
walls, burning continuously to light the room.

Inside this overly large room stands many {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn{x {Wstatues{x, as if someone
has made a collection of them.  They are scattered all over, lining the
walls and periodically dotting the rich, soft {mc{Ma{Drp{Me{mt{x.  One of the large
walls of this room has been completely covered in a rich {yw{ro{yod{x with a smooth
e{yg{Yr{yain{x.  A {ywo{ro{yden{x fireplace has also been carved, covered in swirls and
loops.  Above its elegant mantle hangs an antique {gt{Ga{wp{Des{wt{Gr{gy{x woven with battle

foot of the bed.  And, on the ceiling, long beams of {yha{rrd{ywood{x create a grid.
In the spaces that these beams create, a skilled artisan has painted scenes
of {Db{wa{Wtt{wl{De{x.

High Lords Apartments~
The spotless {RR{re{Rd {rv{Relve{rt{x carpet stretches from wall to wall.  The {rma{yhoga{rny{x
end at the stairwell to be replaces with the solid wall of the Stone.  While
richly decorated, this is obviously still a fortress and the halls are wide
enough to allow for a small contingent of guards to hurry through quickly. 

The stairs here lead to the other levels and the walls to the outside are
broken by open cuts in the stone, wide on the inside and narrow on the
outside which are designed to be wide enough to fire arrows through, but too
narrow to allow entry.

{bH{Big{bh {yL{Yo{Wr{yd{x Anteroom~
This large room is very elegant and open.  The walls have been papered
with thick {bs{Bt{yr{Yi{yp{Be{bs{x of rich {bb{Blu{be{x and {yg{Yol{yd{x.  One of these walls has been
turned into an art gallery of sorts, covered in {yg{Yi{Wld{Ye{yd{x frames of all sizes
that hold detailed paintings and portraits.  Another wall has narrow windows
carved into it, allowing a gentle breeze in to cool the room.  Yet another
wall supports a very large {Dfi{wre{Wp{wla{Dce{x that is surrounded by a mantle made
from carved {yg{Yol{yd{x-{yst{Yr{Wea{Yk{yed {Wma{yr{Yb{Wle{x.  Without a {rf{Rl{Ya{Rm{re{x, one can see through the
fireplace, into the bedroom.  Beautiful {yg{Yi{Wld{Ye{yd{x stands are scattered along
the walls, holding {Wpo{wrc{Welain v{wa{Wses{x filled with draping {Wga{Yr{Wd{ge{Wnias{x that flood
the room with their rich, sweet scent.

decorated in {yg{Yol{yd{x and {Wwhite{x.  A {Wm{ya{Yr{Wble{x floor stretches all around, leading
up to two steps that create a stage of sorts, against the far wall.  Upon
this platform, separated from the rest of the room by its height, a rich,
soft {yr{Yu{Wg{x has been laid that supports a massive {yc{Ya{Wno{Yp{yy {ybed{x.  On both the west
and north walls, narrow windows have been carved that are covered with sheer
{yg{Yol{yd{x fabric, allowing a filtered, romantic light into the room.  {yG{Yol{yd{x
stands, similar to those in the anteroom, decorate the space between each
window.  They hold {Wcr{cy{Cs{ct{Wal{x vases filled with fresh Tairen {Wor{Yc{Whids{x.  Also, on

The {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x stairs here lead to the other levels and the walls to the
outside are broken by open cuts in the {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x, wide on the inside and narrow
on the outside which are designed to be wide enough to fire {yarrows{x through,
but too narrow to allow entry.  The stairway becomes much more elaborated as
it continues down, with the banisters decorated with {rr{Re{rd {rs{Ri{rlk{x {rs{Rpiral{rs{x upward

Parting the {Dco{wb{Ww{we{Dbs{x to peer down this dark hallway, one would see a years
old mess.  Clearly no one ever comes here or there would be {Dboot{xprints
dragged through the {Dd{yu{ws{Dt{x on the floor.  The smell here is heavy and old -
almost rotting.  For some reason, this floor of the {yS{wt{Do{wn{ye{x appears to have

it helded, crumbling to a pile of {ys{Dti{ycks{x and broken {Wp{wot{Wte{wr{Wy{x - the flowers
have long since turned to {Dd{yu{ws{Dt{x.  The lighting is dismal at best because the

On one wall stands a large {yg{Yi{Wld{Ye{yd{x mirror, big enough that a person could see
the entire length of his body.  Next to it is an ornately carved {rcherry{ywood{x
washstand with a {Wma{yr{Yb{Wle{x top.  Another {cm{Cirro{cr{x decorates the wall above the
stand.  Carved {Wma{yr{Yb{Wle pillars{x are scattered about the room, creating the
illusion of height and grandeur.  The ceiling that they connect to is
painted to look like the Tairen {Csky{x, with {Wcl{wo{Wuds{x that almost move as you
study them.  In the center of these pillars stands a very large {Wma{yr{Yb{Wle{x tub,
raised on two stairs from the floor.  The tub is surrounded by {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn{x stands
that hold tall, burning {Wcandles{x and soft, fluffy {Wwhite{x towels.  A box of

Much bigger than the other rooms in the {ySe{Yr{Dva{Yn{yt's {WQ{wuarter{Ws{x, the {yMa{Yj{Dhe{Yr{ye's{x
is beautifully decorated in {rr{Re{rd{x and {Yy{yello{Yw{x.  There is a {rcherry{ywood{x bed with
two mattresses that has a {Yy{yello{Yw{x coverlet spread on it against the wall
across and a {rcherry{ywood{x desk with a matching arm chair close to the bed.
The wardrobe and the table are also made of the same type of {rw{yo{ro{yd{x. Standing
a few feet away from the {rfi{Rr{Ye{Wp{Yl{Ra{rce{x, a pale {Yy{yello{Yw{x arm chair can be seen.

that is wide enough to allow several soldiers to pass at a time.  The floors
are a smooth {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x, worn shiny by the many {Dboots{x that tread upon it each
day.  Compared to other parts of the {yS{Yt{Do{Yn{ye{x, this hall is rather barren, but

plain, almost looking like a long tunnel.  The floors are kept clear of
dried {ym{ru{yd{x that might be tracked in with {Dboot{x heels, a necessity, as High
Lord's could stop here for a conference with Defender leaders at any time. 
Several {Di{wr{Don l{wa{Wm{wp{Ds{x light the way, allowing you to see that the hall
stretches to the west and turns here, leading to the south.

Inside this small, barren room, two soldiers reside.  They are under

regular inspections.  Aside from the {yb{Wun{yk{x, there is little in this room.  A

The long {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x hall comes to an end here, just outside of three formal
doors.  Having just come from a hall of plain {ywood{x portals, these doors
stand out because they are stained a dark, {rrich{x color.  The floor of the
hall also changes from simple {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x to a carved paving {D{yt{wo{yn{De{x, carefully layed
out like a puzzle and filled with a lighter {yg{wro{yut{x to emphasize the shapes. 
The change in decor symbolizes that people of import reside behind these
doors.

Outside the {ys{Dt{wo{Dn{ye{x, a large {ywo{Do{yden{x door with {Di{wr{Wo{Dn{x braces blocks entry to
the east.  Here, the defenders patrol a private port that is used to keep
the fortress stocked with supplies.  On any given day, workers and sailors
alike unload several vessels that tie to these ports, filling the docks with
{ycr{Yat{yes{x and {yba{Drr{yels{x.

Large {ywooden{x docks have been built all around, anchored to the {yS{Dt{wo{Dn{ye{x with
large posts.  These posts also serve as supports in the {Bw{Ca{Wt{Ce{Br{x, covered with
{Dba{wr{Wnic{wl{Des{x to several feet down.  Along these docks are thick {Ds{wt{We{we{Dl{x hooks for

workers throng, tying and knotting, to ensure the safety of everything
around them.

Several large {yve{Ds{ysels{x light on this private dock daily to deliver
supplies to the {yS{Dt{wo{Dn{ye{x of Tear.  When they are safely tied, workers board the
ships and begin their tasks, unloading and stacking {ycr{Da{ytes{x, {yba{Dr{wr{De{yls{x and

these ports, inspecting all items that are to be taken into the fortress.

On either side of this dock are two large sailing {ys{Dh{yips{x, tied for the

many of these things are finery for the High Lords.  All around, these docks
bustle like ports in any city might, with the sound of screeching {Wg{Du{Wlls{x as
they dive for {Rf{Yi{Rsh{x, or the grunts of men as they attempt to lift heavy
{ycr{Da{ytes{x.  Defenders patrol idly to ensure order and protection.

By a wall of the Stone of Tear~
Looking up, you see one of the {Dmass{wi{Dve{x {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x walls that make the fortress
called the {DS{wt{Wo{wn{De{x of {yT{Ye{Da{yr{x.  The wall is very {Ww{wi{Dd{We{x, as far as the eyes can
see, on each direction and very {Dh{wi{Dgh{x, enough to cause a uncomfortable
feeling on your neck.  The humidity of the air has made the {Dst{wo{Wn{we{Ds{x slippery
and very flat along the years.  It seems impossible to climb it.  Only a

must be carefully measured, looking for the right space between the stones
to use to climb.  Sometimes {Da{wr{Wr{wo{Dw {Ds{ylit{Ds{x on the walls make the job slightly
easier, but still much more risky at the same time, because of the {yg{Yu{Dar{Yd{ys{x

Secret Dungeon entrance~
This narrow corridor has its walls made of worn-out {Ddark g{wr{Dey{x {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x and
the same material is used on the floor.  {yDust{x forms a thick later
everywhere, with clouds floating upwards everytime someone takes even the
lightest of the steps.  A single {yt{Yo{Dr{Yc{yh{x lights the room, revealing a {Dm{we{Wt{wa{Dl
{Dg{wrad{De{x with a door northwards, to keep this room safe.

Secret Dungeon~
With little {yl{Yi{Dg{Yh{yt{x to tell otherwise, this room doesn't seem much
different than the others around here.  Walls and floor made of {Ddark g{wr{Dey{x
{Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x that looks worn-out and {yd{Dir{yty{x.  Faint shuffling noise echoes in the
air but it is hard to identify where the noise is coming from.

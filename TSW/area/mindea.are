Lugard Road~
The town of Mindea lies upon Lugard Road, the main route between the town
of Four Kings and the cities of Caemlyn and Lugard.  The road is basically a
wide muddy track that runs north/south through the northern part of the
town.  On either side of the road are a few small clusters of old wooden
buildings which gradually thin out to the north.  The buildings around this
town generally look as if they badly need repairs and a fresh coat of
whitewash on their wooden exteriors.  There appears to be not very many
buildings in this town without rusted hinges on window shutters and doors,
or with loose tiles upon their roofs.

Lugard Road~
Deep groove marks can be seen etched into the surface of this long
north/south road; the constant wear and tear of traffic over the years
passing through this route has taken its toll upon the surface of the road. 
Overlooking the road along both sides are tall houses constructed from wood;
their exteriors appear to be badly weathered and a quick inspection of the
buildings' tiled roofs show an urgent need of repair to these abodes.  Even
the shutters upon the windows are either missing or have rusted due to the
neglect of these buildings.  The number of houses decreases to the north
until only one or two odd-looking shacks can be seen upon the outskirts of
the town.

Lugard Road~
Lugard Road is a very long and wide north/south road which provides a
route between Lugard, Four Kings and Caemlyn.  The road is merely a simple
wide dirt track that has been worn down in places by heavy carts and wagons
that pass along this road.  Along the west side of the road is a group of
closely packed wooden houses whose dull exteriors had once a long time ago
been graced with a coat of white wash, but now these buildings are looking
decidedly haggard.  A couple of dark narrow alleyways lead between the
buildings and away from this thoroughfare.  A second road leads away from
this point to the east; in the distance a stone bridge can be seen.

Lugard Road~
Lugard Road is a very long and wide north/south road which provides a
route between Lugard, Four Kings and Caemlyn.  The road has not been
maintained properly; there is a sign of years of wear and tear in the
surface of the road with deep groove marks where heavily laden wagons and
carts have crossed.  Along the west side of the road is a row of wooden
buildings, mostly houses but a few shops and even some stables can be seen. 
On the east side of the road is a brick wall; approximately six feet in
height but towering above the wall on the far side is a large group of
trees.

Lugard Road~
Lugard Road is a very long and wide north/south road which provides a
route between Lugard, Four Kings and Caemlyn.  The road itself is not too
badly worn but a few repairs could be made to the road's surface to ensure
that most wagon drivers would have a more comfortable journey along this
route.  On both sides of the road neat rows of wooden buildings have been
constructed; the majority being houses but a few shops and even some stables
can be seen.  Where there are no buildings there are plots of bare land used
by merchants to park their wagons whilst they stop over in the town; these
areas seem to be heavily supervised by merchants' guards.

Lugard Road~
This section of Lugard Road is a relatively quiet part of Mindea when
compared to other parts of the rundown town.  This north/south running
thoroughfare passes between two rows of shops and houses that have been
built on either side of the road.  Occasionally breaking up the neat rows
are dark and narrow alleyways passing between the buildings or small areas
of barren land used by merchants to park their wagons whilst they are
frequenting the local inns and taverns.  A few stables can also be seen
nearby; their presence along the road is probably the cause of the distinct
stench of horses in the air around here.

Lugard Road~
Lugard Road is a very long and wide north/south road which provides a
route between Lugard, Four Kings and Caemlyn.  Unlike the section road that
can be seen to the south of this one, this part of Mindea is quieter.  From
the road few shops, taverns and stables can be seen dotted amongst the
tightly packed rows of wooden houses that have been built along the
roadsides.  Where there are no buildings there are plots of bare earth have
been left burdened with dozens of merchants' wagons parked closely together
and abandoned save for the guards that watch over them.

Lugard Road~
A long muddy road, wide enough for wagons to pass by each other runs
through the center of this dead beat town.  The town is comprised of many
wooden buildings all crammed together.  Any open space within the town has
been taken up merchants who have parked their wagons on muddy patches of
ground; once such area can be seen not too far away on the south side of the
road just in front of a rundown inn.  Although the majority of the buildings
are in need of heavy repairs, there are a few buildings that have had some
time devoted to their care and maintenance.  But in this part of the town
there are mainly inns, taverns, stables and horse lots; only a few
whitewashed houses can be seen amongst the larger buildings.

Lugard Road~
The sounds of rowdy tavern patrons as well as the heavy clanging of
blacksmiths working at their forges can be heard most of the day and night
throughout the town of Mindea.  This is Lugard Road, the main thoroughfare
that leads east/west through the center of the town, the road is used mainly
by traveling merchants and peddlers with their heavy wagons, and the road is
so rutted by the wear and tear of the traffic.  Around this section of the
town are mainly stables and horse lots, but a few hideous brightly painted
taverns can be seen amongst the usual drab rundown houses and shops that
look in dire need of having their exteriors whitewashed once more.

Lugard Road~
Lugard Road is wide enough to allow heavy goods wagons to pass by each
other with ease yet the deep ruts and groves marks in the surface of the
road make the route an uncomfortable one.  Dotted around the town are large
bare areas of mud used to park the many wagons that belong to the merchants.
Where there is no mud, there is usually a wooden building; there are many
dilapidated houses and shops built in clusters around the town.  Other
buildings such as stables and horse lots have been built here especially for
the merchants who frequent this area as well as some gaudily painted taverns
and inns.  Over the top of the din created by these rowdy establishments
there is clanging from blacksmiths working at their forges making the town a
noisy place to stay both day and night.

Lugard Road~
The Lugard Road has probably seen better days in the past, but now it has
been reduced to a wide mud track road, wide enough for large carts and
wagons to pass although the thoroughfare but heavily rutted from overuse and
lack of repairs.  The state of the densely packed buildings of Mindea
reflect the state of the old road, some houses are barely more than
overgrown wooden shacks and almost all of the exteriors of the buildings
have been whitewashed.  The only buildings graced with much color at all are
the gaudy inns and taverns, each and every one of them a source of raucous
noises from their noisy patrons.  Window shutters hang from rusted hinges as
if frozen in time from lack of use and oil whilst loose slates hang
precariously from rooftops awaiting their inevitable end.

Lugard Road~
This is a dangerous crossing where Lugard Road meets with two other
roads.  A collection of dilapidated whitewashed buildings, perhaps shops or
even houses can be seen due south of this point although there is little
difference between the state of these buildings and the ones that lie along
the other roads.  To the west is the heart of Mindea, not that there is very
much to see down that road apart from some tacky old inns, a couple of
stables and perhaps smithy; the ringing of blacksmiths working at their
forges can be heard almost constantly around the small town, both day and
night.  There is more of the same to the east, although along that stretch
of road the buildings appear to be less cramped together than they are
anywhere else in the town.

Lugard Road~
Lugard Road is the main thoroughfare within the town of Mindea and is
used by merchants traveling to and from Lugard and the mining towns in the
west of Andor.  It is a wide dirt track running north/south through the town
and is towered over by rows of dull wooden buildings including numerous
stables and horse lots tightly packed together on either side of the road. 
The road has been worn down so badly by years of heavy use by merchant's
carts and wagons that there are almost trench-like wheel impressions upon
the road's surface.  The buildings on the east side of the road appear to be
small shops; they have brightly painted window and door frames which
contrast greatly with the duller houses of the area.

Lugard Road~
Lugard Road is the most heavily used road through the town of Mindea as
it is part of the major trade route from Lugard to the mining towns of
Andor.  The road's surface is heavily worn in places looks to be in need of
some repairs; any wagon driver traveling along this road would be in for a
bumpy ride.  Along both sides of the road numerous wooden buildings have
been built, their dull exteriors coated in whitewash.  The only buildings to
have escaped this curse of dullness are a few shops and one or two taverns
that display brightly painted features.  Amongst the clumps of buildings are
areas of barren land left as parking areas for the wagons of visiting
merchants; most of the areas are packed with wagons as well as snooping
merchants' guards.

Lugard Road~
Lugard Road is the main road though Mindea which carries Lugard's trade
with the mines in the west of Andor along it.  The majority of the buildings
that have been built along the Lugard Road are stables and horse lots,
although there are a few shops and houses to be seen.  The buildings
themselves, mainly constructed from wood are in an awful state; many of the
window shutters have rusted up through lack of maintenance and paint flakes
easily away from the wooden surfaces of the buildings.  Dark narrow alleys
can be seen between some of the closely packed houses but where they lead
remains a mystery shrouded in the shadows of the alleyway.  Where there are
no buildings along the roadside there are large plots of bare earth filled
with wagons closely together.

Lugard Road~
Lugard Road is most heavily used road through the town of Mindea as it is
part of the major trade route from Lugard in the south, to the mining towns
near the Mountains of Mist to the northwest.  Most of the buildings along
the Lugard Road have been built very close to the roadside although there
are some exceptions.  Along the west side of the road are a few thatched
cottages; each building has been built far back enough from the roadside to
allow for a small plot of land as gardens at their fronts.  Some of the
locals have taken the opportunity to express their artistic talents with
profusions of colors within each little flower garden.  A large building on
the east side of the road can be seen; it too has a small plot of land being
used as a decorative flower garden.

Lugard's trade with the mines in the west of Andor along it.  Many buildings
have been constructed along the Lugard Road very close to the roadside
itself although a few exceptions can be seen in this area of the road. 
Along both sides of the road are a few old thatched cottages with thatched
roofs; each building has been built far back enough from the roadside to
allow for a small plot of land as gardens at their fronts.  Each plot has
been used to create a dazzling yet unique floral display which almost seems
impossible to comprehend when considering the blandness of the majority of
the buildings within rest of the town.

Lugard Road~
Here lies Lugard Road, a long road that leads through the town of Mindea.
The road is wide and badly rutted by the years of use by merchants' with
their heavily laden carts and wagons passing along this thoroughfare.  Along
the east side of the road is a tightly packed row off dull shops and houses;
the buildings become less compacted together further south down the road. 
Although the majority of the buildings in this area of the town are
constructed from stone and possess thatched roofs, a few relatively newer
wooden buildings with tiled roofs can be seen.  A second, less worn road
leads away from this point to the west towards a small stone bridge.

Lugard Road~
Lugard Road is part of the route commonly used by merchants and traders
traveling from the mining towns near the Mountains of Mist in western Andor
and Lugard, capital of Murandy to the south.  The road itself is very old
and in need of repairs; deep ruts have been carved into the road's surface
by the many heavy merchants' wagons that have passed along this road.  On
both sides of the road a few shops and houses have been built quite well
spread apart, as opposed to the tightly packed rows of houses that can be
seen further north up Lugard Road.  The buildings at this point are also
hugely different in their construction from the plain wooden ones near the
center of the town; these are much older buildings have been constructed
from stone and have thatched roofs.

Lugard Road~
The town of Mindea is little more than a large, over developed village
that thrives on the trade and custom brought to it by merchants and traders
traveling through the town.  Much of the town is in a dilapidated state;
here on the outskirts of the town a few of the older houses can be seen,
constructed from stone with thatched roofs, a huge contrast to the wooden
shack-like buildings towards the center of the town.  The Lugard Road cuts
directly through the decrepit town; it is the part of the trading route
between the mining towns near the Mountains of Mist to the northwest and the
capital city of Murandy, Lugard.

Inishlinn Road~
Inishlinn Road generally follows an east/west course through the northern
part of Mindea.  The mud track road is wide enough to allow wagons to pass
by each other quite easily but the surface is rutted from years of overuse
by such heavy vehicles.  A stone bridge can be seen a short distance away to
the east bisecting the thoroughfare.  Along the south side of the road an
ivy covered brick wall approximately six feet in height has been constructed
beyond which some tall trees can be seen in the distance.  Along the
opposite side of the road several wooden houses with whitewashed exteriors
have been built; they look a little ragged and could do with some
maintenance.

A Small Bridge~
Built along the south side of Inishlinn Road is a gray brick wall
approximately six feet in height; a few tall trees poke over the wall.  At
this point along the road the wall forms part of the structure of a wide
bridge which at first glance appears to serve no real purpose.  On the north
side of the gently arcing bridge are plain iron railings that are
approximately four foot tall and have been painted black.  Beyond the rails
what appears to be a man-made channel of water about five feet below the
bridge.  On either side of the water channel are steep grassy embankments;
the mixture of mud and grass looks too slippery to scale.  There is one
usual thing about the waterway that it flows northwards instead of south,
perhaps there is a source of water within Mindea itself?

part of Mindea.  Along the south side of the road a brick wall approximately
six feet in height has been constructed beyond which trees can be seen in
the distance; greenery being an unusual sight within this dull town unless
the gaudily painted taverns and shops are counted.  An example of such awful
monstrosities can be seen across the road to the north where one tall
whitewashed building; a shop has had its window and door frames painted in a
sickly sea green color.  There is not much to see in the distance to the
east apart from an area full of merchants' wagons which is quite common for
this town.  To the west a bridge can be seen bisecting the road; it looks
like it has been constructed from stone.

Inishlinn Road~
The wide track known as Inishlinn Road forms at sharp bend at this point.
Although at this point a large fenced off area of bare land with a mass of
parked wagons can be seen to the east, further down the road to the south
there appears to be decrepit wooden buildings whilst along the west side of
the road a brick wall approximately six feet in height has been built.  The
wall follows the curvature of Inishlinn Road and continues westwards where
also in the distance a stone bridge can be seen bisecting the thoroughfare. 
On the north side of this sharp corner, a particularly large building has
been constructed from stone with several tall chimneys; it looks strangely
out of place amongst the wooden buildings built around it.

The clanging of blacksmiths at work in their forges and the ruckuses from
rowdy tavern patrons can be heard throughout Mindea, even here in Inishlinn
Road.  The long road runs north/south though the northern part of the town;
along the east side of the road are mainly wooden buildings such as houses,
shops and taverns and built along the east side of the road is a brick wall,
approximately six feet height.  At this point along the road there is a
small area of bare ground to the east where merchants have parked their
wagons; probably whilst they are visiting the gaudy red and white painted
tavern that lies beyond the muddy area.

few large plots of bare land can be seen sandwiched between tightly pack

there are mainly stables and inns; a sure sign that this town is built up
from business brought in by outsiders such as merchants.  On the west side

shops and houses can be seen here.  On the west side of the road a large
brick wall, approximately six feet high has been built.  A tall iron gateway
painted black appears to be the only entrance into the built up area;
peering through the bars of the gate reveals a small recreational park
beyond the wall.

Conlin Road~
This particular road is wide enough to allow carts and wagons to pass
each other with ease yet the bad state of the road where ruts and holes have
not been filled in would make any journey along this thoroughfare a bumpy
experience.  Most of the buildings and amenities along this road cater
solely for the patronage of these travelers with numerous taverns, inns,
stables as well as horse lots.  Some areas of the town have been set aside
solely for the parking of wagons; there are many plots of bare earth around
the town packed with closely parked wagons being attended to by merchants'
guards.  There are small clusters of dilapidated wooden houses and around
the town broken up only by narrow alleys that wind their way through the
residential districts

Conlin Road~
The town of Mindea could hardly be considered among the most picturesque
of Murandian towns and villages.  It appears to be no more than an overgrown
village that has built up over the years by the patronage of merchants and
traders that travel through this area.  The town is basically collection of
wooden buildings houses, shops, a few large inns, taverns, stables and horse
lots and is divided by the main roads that run past them and a few dark and
narrow alleys.  This particularly point within the town seems to be where
the major concentration of stables and blacksmiths' workshops are located
but also along the roadside are large areas of barren muddy ground used by
merchants to park their carts and wagons whilst they visit the local inns.

Conlin Road has been worn down by years of use by heavy merchants' and
goods wagons that pass through the area.  The town of Mindea itself is no
more than a collection of run down hovels grouped in small clusters around
larger and slightly grander taverns, inns, stables and horse lots although
the concentration of buildings diminishes along the road from west to east
from this point.  Most of the open areas within the town have been left bare
as plots for merchants to park their wagons whilst they visit the taverns or
just buy provisions for their journeys; one such area can be seen on the
south side of the road, just in front of a large brightly painted inn.

of Mindea are few and far between; the main concentration of local housing
appears to be to the west from here beyond the inns, taverns and stables
that have been built right up close to the muddy thoroughfare.  Window
shutters dangle precariously from corroded hinges and many of the buildings
dotted around Mindea are missing a few of the tiles from their roofs; there
is a distinct feeling of neglect within this town.  There are very few
things within Mindea that can be considered appealing to the eye except
those who find viewing large muddy areas filled with parked merchants'
wagons interesting.  One such area can be seen to the south that lies before
a hideous brightly painted inn.

Conlin Road~
This is Conlin Road, one of several thoroughfares that twist their way
around the town of Mindea.  To the west are a few small clusters of old
wooden buildings, mainly houses, inns and taverns can be seen built around
the road.  There are also a fair number of stables and horse lots to be seen
within the town from here, patronized by merchants who travel through the
town.  Even from this point Mindea looks like a neglected town, much of the
buildings within this area are old and in need of urgent repairs, mainly
have not had their wooden board exteriors repainted since their
construction.

Western Road~
Mindea is far from picturesque little town; it is a muddle of wooden
shack-like buildings.  The town is merely a stopover point for traveling
merchants; nearly every one of the shops and amenities of the town catering
for them rather than the locals.  Most of the buildings are in need of
repair, and all of them could do with a fresh coat of paint, a lot of the
houses, even the inns and taverns of the town have their window shutters
half hanging off from rusted hinges.  Where there are no buildings there is
barren earth; even Western Road is no more than a glorified mud track wide
enough for wagons to pass.  Many merchants' wagons can be seen parked up
along the side of the road in large barren areas of mud that lay in front of
inns, taverns and stables

Western Road~
Mindea is a particularly noisy town with its taverns almost always full
of rowdy clientele as well as the clanging of local blacksmiths working
intensely at their forges.  Western Road runs through this busy section of
the town with many wagons and carts traveling in both directions along this
wide yet deeply pitted mud track.  All of the buildings along this road are
little more than wooden shacks that are closely packed together with
exteriors that are badly needing to be whitewashed once more; only the
taverns of the town have been painted in bright colors.  Among the buildings
are many stables and horse lots to be found within the town; a stench of
horses lingers in the air.  One such establishment lies on the north side of
this road past a muddy area full of parked wagons.

Western Road~
Western Road is little more than a wide track of mud that runs through
the town of Mindea, wide enough for wagons to pass by easily yet old, rutted
and in need of repair after the many years of traffic that has used this old
thoroughfare.  On either side of Western Road are numerous stables and horse
lots as well as brightly painted taverns and inns that stand out from
amongst the houses and shops that have their wooden exteriors painted with
whitewash.  Bare patches of ground by the roadside have become the home for
many merchants' wagons whilst their owners stopover in one of the inns of
Mindea.  A secondary road almost as wide as Western Road leads away to the
south from this point.

Western Road~
Both day and night a huge ruckus can be heard throughout the town of
Mindea, the main sources of the noise are the many blacksmiths working at
their forges as well as the rowdy goings-on in the inns and taverns that are
scattered throughout the town.  One such brightly painted monstrosity can be
seen a short distance away on the north side of Western Road beyond a large
area of muddy ground used to park merchants' wagons.  Upon the south side of
the deeply pitted road are a small cluster of drab and rundown shops that
have been built right next to the roadside leaving little or no room for any
wagons to park out at the front of these shops.

Western Road~
Built beside the busy Western Road are many tightly packed shops and
houses.  Most of the wooden buildings have been painted with whitewash, but
by the condition of the exteriors of the majority of the buildings it
appears to have been a very long time ago since these houses have actually
had a fresh coat of paint.  Often in front of the larger buildings,
especially the inns and taverns are areas of bare mud used by merchants to
park their wagons; many of the wagons are so clustered up tightly together
it looks like a near impossible task to untangle and move the vehicles.  At
this point on the south side of Western Road are a small cluster of shops
that have been built right next to the roadside leaving no room for any
wagons to park out at the front of these shops.

Western Road~
Western Road cuts directly through the center of the town of Mindea.  The
road is old and in need of repairs; deep ruts have been carved into the
road's surface by the many heavy merchants' wagons that have passed along
this thoroughfare.  Built along the sides of the road are many wooden
buildings; the majority appear to be plain white-washed constructions but a
couple of garishly painted taverns can be seen along this route.  Another
road leads southwards from this point; just as wide as Western Road but
distinctly lacking the color brought to the main road by the colorful
taverns.

Western Road~
The town of Mindea is little more than a large, over developed village
that thrives on the trade and custom brought to it by merchants and traders
traveling through the town.  Much of the town is in a dilapidated state;
here on the outskirts of the town a few of the locals' houses can be seen,
they look like over grown wooden shacks and much of the boards of the wooden
buildings looks like they are in dire need of a fresh coat of whitewash.

Naloy Crescent~
Naloy Crescent appears to be part of one of the residential areas of
Mindea; the area being comprised mainly of tall wooden houses that are
tightly packed together with just a few narrow alleyways that cut between
some of the buildings.  The crescent is void of any gaudy painted taverns
and inns, although a few shops can be seen lurking around but they appear to
be no more than small converted hovels.  A few attempts have been made to
brighten up the housing around Naloy Crescent; a few window boxes and
hanging baskets displaying brightly colored flowers decorate a few of the
houses along here.  The road is a particularly wide mud track, at least as
wide as the road that can be seen in the distance to the north, but this
thoroughfare looks far less worn down.

Naloy Crescent~
Tall whitewashed wooden houses have been built upon both sides of the
road at Naloy Crescent.  Most of the houses look old and rickety, some
repairs and a fresh coat of whitewash would probably put them right.  Roofs
with loose tiles and window shutters are generally hanging from rusted up
hinges; most of the poorer villages around the district are in a better
state than this place.  There are a few exceptions where the residents have
maintained their houses and even some have decorated their homes with little
flower displays in window boxes and hanging baskets; none of the houses upon
the crescent have room for any gardens at the front as their front doors are
almost on the road itself.

but there are one or two exceptions amongst them.  Naloy Crescent is no more
than a dirt track, wide enough for wagons to pass by each other.  There is a
wide yet gentle bend in the road here; to the north there appears to be even
more houses that are closely packed together in neat rows along both sides
of the road and to the east there are a few more houses but there also
appears to be a large area of ground with many small wagons and carts parked
closely together upon it.

Naloy Crescent is a wide mud track road that runs through one of the
residential areas of the town of Mindea.  Along the south side of the road
are houses, the majority of the buildings are old and neglected and even at
this distance away from them, many can be seen to be in need of a lot of
repairs.  The north side of the road is not much better either, there is a
large area of flat muddy ground which is being used to park small merchants'
and traders' wagons.  Beyond the wagons are a small group of shops, the
window and door frames of the buildings have been painted in bright colors
but the majority of the wooden exterior structure of these buildings have
been whitewashed much like the houses on the opposite side of the road.

Along the south side of the road is a row of small wooden houses with tiled
roofs, tightly packed together.  A few of the houses even have small yet
colorful displays of flowers and herbs growing in decorative window boxes
and hanging baskets; all of the houses have been built so closely to the
edge of the road there is no room for any gardens at the front.  Upon the
north side of Naloy Crescent is a large area of flat muddy ground which is
being used to park small merchants' and traders' wagons.  Beyond the tightly

frames of these whitewashed buildings have been painted in bright colors as
opposed to the duller houses to the south.

The rowdy cheering and signing within taverns and the ringing of iron
upon iron as blacksmiths work at their forges can be heard throughout the
town of Mindea both day and night.  Used mostly by traders and merchants as
a stop off point in their journeys through Murandy most of the amenities
within the town cater solely for that market.  Naloy Crescent may be one of
the residential areas, mostly comprised of tall wooden houses with dark
tiled roofs and whitewashed exteriors, yet deep grooves etched in the wide
mud track road suggest that this thoroughfare has not escaped the use of by
merchants.

There is very little to see along Naloy Crescent for its one of only a
few roads within Mindea where the majority of the buildings built along side
of it are residential ones.  At this point the road runs straight from north
to south and is wide enough to allow wagons to pass each other with ease. 
The road does not show as much wear and tear as other roads within the town
boundaries do; the road running east/west can be seen a short distance away
to the north is a perfect example.

Coralle Road is a wide north/south mud track that has been worn down and
deeply rutted from the heavy carts and wagons that travel along this route
through Mindea.  Along the west side of the road a row of small shops have
been built right up close to the roadside; the colorfully painted window and
door frames of these shops are a distinct contrast to the duller appearances
of the houses in the area.  Upon the east side of Coralle Road there appears
to be a small recreational park, surrounded by a sturdy wooden perimeter
fence; it seems to be one of only a few areas of greenery within Mindea.

Coralle Road is a relatively quiet area of Mindea although the some of
the rowdy jeering from the town's inns and taverns can be heard in the
distance.  The thoroughfare is quite wide, wide enough to allow large carts
and wagons to easily pass by each other.  On the east side of the road
beyond a long waist-height wooden fence is a small recreational park; the
few trees and shrubs planted in this area are one of the most colorful parts
of the town when comparing it to the dirty grays, whites and browns of the
buildings constructed in Mindea.  Along the west side of the road are
several examples of such bland constructions; a row of small shops have been
built right up close to the roadside.

Although this mud track road is deeply rutted by the wear and tear caused
by heavily laden carts and wagons, Coralle Road runs through one of the
quieter regions of the town of Mindea.  At this point along Coralle Road
forms a bend; along the bend to the east the road continues for a
considerable distance until it joins with a stone bridge whilst along the
road to the north a few shops and houses can be seen.  Across the road in a
northeasterly direction appears to be a small grassy area with a few trees
which is recreation park; it is probably one of only a few areas of greenery
within the Murandian town.

Coralle Road is a wide mud track road that follows a straight east/west
route through one of the quieter residential districts of Mindea.  Along the
south side of the road are a few thatched cottages; these stone and brick
houses appear to be much older than the wooden structures that can be seen
further north towards the center of the town.  Constructed out of the same
type of stone to the east is a wide bridge that crosses over a small stream
that bisects this thoroughfare.  Beyond a waist-high wooden fence to the
north is a small recreational park; one of only a few areas in Mindea with
much color within it.

and some of the bridge's masonry look loose.  The stream is quite shallow
and flows northwards through a small area that appears to be a small
recreational park which is surrounded by a sturdy waist-high fence.  Along
the south side of the roads joined by the bridge are a few thatched cottages
and on the east side of the bridge there is even a guardhouse; these stone
and brick buildings appear to be much older than the wooden structures that

Coralle Road is one of the longest yet quietest roads that run through
the town of Mindea.  This road, like the others within the town is a long
mud track wide enough for wagons to pass by each other easily; the only
difference is that Coralle Road shows relatively little wear in its surface
when compared to its neighbor to the east.  On the south side of the road
are a few old cottages; stone buildings with almost dome-like thatched roofs
which do not fit in with the newer wooden buildings that can be seen towards
the center of the town.  Overlooking the road on the north side is a small
row of shops; their colorfully painted wooden signs that hang over their
doorways are an indication to what each shopkeeper sells.

This shop appears to be a shrine to dust and cobwebs.  Fixed to the
western and eastern walls of this room are wine racks which take up the
entire walls' space.  Hundreds of bottles sit in their own individual little
spaces, each one with a thin blanket of gray dust which has settled upon
their exteriors.  The main shop window at the south side of the room next to
the entrance has thick iron bars crossing it.  At the northern end of the
room behind the battered old shop counter is another door, braced with iron
and with a huge padlock fixed on it.

At a first glance this shop appears to be rather empty, the only things
that sit upon the shelves here apart from dust are a set of scales and tiny
weights.  The shop window, even though it is protected by black iron bars is
void of any display.  The reason why the shop appears to be so empty becomes
apparent when looking at the center of the room.  There is a counter in the
middle of the room upon which a reinforced cabinet stands.  There is a glass
panel in the door of the cabinet behind which is a small display of gaudy
jewelry; the majority of the items look like they have been made from
polished brass and cut glass.  Why so much effort has seemingly gone into
protecting these seemingly cheap items remains to be seen.

It is a small building, approximately fifteen feet square with a low
ceiling.  No attempt has been made to decorate the shop, all of the interior
walls and even the floor has been left bare wood although it is stained with
dirt.  A narrow staircase lies on the west side of the room behind the shop
counter but it has been roped off to prevent customers from exploring the
upper parts of the building.  Two windows sit on opposite sides of the room,
on the north and south sides and even the doors set next to the windows

to see within this shop apart from covered junk that has been left to fester
upon rails although through the maze of racks, a small doorway can be seen

The Mindea Weapons Store is the place where dreams are sold if dreams are
rusted, buckled, dented, warped or held together with twine.  The bare
wooden walls and floors of the shop give it a rustic yet dilapidated feel. 
A staircase lies on the east side of the room behind a counter, although it
has been roped off to prevent customers passing.  Two windows have been
built on the north and south sides; each one has a doorway next to them
leading outside.  A third door can be seen at the west end of the room
underneath a moth-eaten Red Bull banner.  Around the shop walls chained upon
racks is the merchandise itself, a few items of weaponry, most of the items
appear to be as much use as sursa are for eating soup with although there
may be some useful items amongst the junk.

Appearances can be very deceptive.  At a first glance this old and
rundown shop appears to be nothing more than a junk shop whose merchandise
ranges from battered and broken, to rusty or rotten.  The items that are on
display here hung upon the walls of the shop appear to be mainly weapons, a
few corroded excuses for daggers, swords and some other items that look like
they are held together with just string and glue.  Perhaps among the very
few sturdy and well made things within this establishment is the wooden
counter set at the center of the shop as well as the door on the west side
of the room that leads back outside the shop.

{rA Bowyer's Shop{x~
A cool draught from underneath the main door on the east side of the room
stirs up a multicolored cloud of feathers.  The shop is small and much of
the space has been taken up by the shop counter that sits near the western
end of the room, a few paces in front of a large wooden door.  A selection
of unstrung bows stand in a rack that has been fixed upon the northern wall,
they appear to be rather plain, nothing that warrants a seal of master
craftsmanship.  In the northeast corner of the room underneath a large
barred window are several wooden casks, once used to store spirits, now
their lids have been removed and they are being used to store a multitude of
arrows.

{bA Blacksmith's Workshop{x~
The blacksmith's workshop is one of the only buildings within Mindea that
is almost entirely made of brick and stone.  Intense heat radiates from the
stone forge that has been built on the north side of the room.  There are
several large metal anvils placed close to the forge, each one appears to be
a different size although all of them shows heavy signs of wear and tear. 
Tools such as tongs and hammers hang in neat arrangements on wooden racks
that have been fixed to the walls of the room.  In one corner of the room
there are several large barrels, each one appears to contain water although
the barrels are marked with a different symbol.  There are two exits, a door
on the east side of the room and a second one on the south side of the room
that leads back outside.

{yA Cobbler's Shop{x~
A strong smell of leather fills the air of this quaint little cobbler's
workshop.  On the east side of the room next to the workshop's entrance is a
large shop window that has been used to display some of the cobbler's work
ranging from heavy work boots to dainty slippers.  Although none of the
items on display appear to be the work of a master craftsman they do
actually appear to be well made.  The rest of the room is taken up by a
workbench at the center of the room where bits and pieces of leather
partially forming the cobbler's next creation lay upon it amongst a
scattered cluster of tools.  The south side of the room has mainly been
taken up by rolls of material including leather and velvet.

{rA Weaver's Shop{x~
This is a rather colorful little shop displaying numerous brightly
colored rugs, cloaks and other items woven from wool although there is not
much space to display the items within this shop.  The most likely patrons
of this establishment are probably peddlers and traders who travel between
small towns and large villages, most of the wares here would not look out of
place in a village, despite their bright colorings they look a little plain
for the tastes of most city folk.  Behind a large wooden door on the west
side of this shop the rattle of weaving looms can be heard and the door on
the east side of the shop leads back out into one of the dusty streets of
Mindea.

This is a small hat shop whose main customers are the merchants and
traders that pass through Mindea.  On the west side of the room next to the
doorway leading out of the shop is a large window that overlooks one of the
dusty streets.  Placed on stands upon wooden shelves right next to the
window is a large display of hats, although they are mainly Murandian style,
there are a few examples of foreign styles to be seen, especially Altaran. 
There are larger displays on the north and south side of the shop itself;
there are even a few Cairhienin "bell-shaped" caps, something that probably
would not have been expected in a Murandian shop.  There is a counter on the
east side of the room where the shopkeeper does their transactions or just
to stand there to look important.

is a hefty wooden door that probably leads to either a workshop or perhaps
the living quarters of the shop owner.  There is a second door on the west
side of the room leads back outside to the streets of Mindea.  Next to the
exit is a large shop window which has been used to display the best of the
seamstress' or seamstresses' work, colorful gowns and dresses that would not
look out of place at a feast day celebration, some made from cloth, others
from fine wool are in display here.  Hanging upon more racks within the shop
are other dresses, some are a little plainer than the window display but
look equally well made.

window also on the east side of the room confirms where the second doorway
leads to.  On the north side of the room someone has built a wooden
structure, the bottom half of the structure has been used to display
numerous coats and breeches that have already been made up and probably are
waiting for collection.  The top half of the construction is a sort of
pigeonhole unit used to store numerous thin bolts of cloth in a multitude of
colors and patterns.  There are a few more suits hanging on rails on the
south side of the room, most of them are either cut in an Andoran or a
Murandian style.

As the name which is conveniently painted in bright yet gaudy colors upon
a wooden board on the east wall says this building is a chandler's shop. 
This is a general store full of general items which generally seem to be
quite boring.  Most of the stuff on sale here is geared towards travelers
passing through the town, like dried provisions and traveling equipment. 
The smaller and more valuable merchandise has been placed upon shelves along
the west and east walls; the small step ladder stuck in the northeast corner
of the room explains how the shopkeeper manages to retrieve items for his
customers.  Placed at the east end of the room is a counter where the
transactions in this shop occur.  And of course as the name of the shop
suggests there are candles on sale in this shop.

The term "junk shop" is almost an understatement for this establishment. 
Wall-to-wall trash sits on wooden shelves and racks about the room, most of
the items on display come with free dust, cobwebs and sometimes even rust! 
There does not appear to be any noticeable method of arrangement of the
shop's stock apart from the least rusted, battered, torn and damaged items
have been pushed up to the front of the store and placed on display in the
wide south-facing window that overlooks a busy street.  There are two doors,
one to the north which appears to have been blocked by a heavily rusted suit
of Murandian armor hung upon a dummy, and one to the south which for the
moment appears to be usable.

Why such a rough old town such as Mindea would have a florist's shop will
probably remain a mystery for years to come.  Yet this rather small
cubbyhole of a shop is just one massive display of floral arrangements in
eye wrenching colors; a hay fever sufferer's nightmare perhaps?  Through the
jungle of brightly colored blooms that have been placed on display in
containers is a wooden counter where maybe once transactions may of
occurred, but now it too seems to have succumbed to the floral invasion and
is home to a dramatic trail of creeping ivy whose source appears to be a
rather plain old terracotta pot placed at the edge of the counter. 
Somewhere on the west side of the shop through the foliage is the exit.

A small brass bell fixed to the door signals the arrival and departure of
customers in this rather quaint little bakery that is just off the Lugard
Road.  The air within the room is just full of a mixture of delicious
aromas, of baking bread, cakes and pastries.  The room is rather plain and
dull or it would be if it were not for the eye catching and mouth watering
items that are on display here.  On display in trays upon the shop counter
at the center of the room and in the shop window on the west side of the
room are selections of the baker's wares.  There is second door on the east
side of the room behind the shop counter; it probably leads into the kitchen
or perhaps the baker's living quarters, it's impossible to see through a
closed door.

This is a rather peculiar little shop that has been tucked away on the
outskirts of Mindea.  This plain room has been partitioned in two by a long
wooden counter.  A large grimy window on the southern half of the room
overlooks Inishlinn Road and next to the window is a doorway leading onto
the busy thoroughfare.  Behind the shop counter on the north side of the
room is a small door from which a pungent cheesy aroma is emanating from. 
An attempt to cover up the cheesy smell has been made by hanging bunches of
dried lavender around the shop but results in combination of aromas that may
be nauseating to some.

area, adding some color to this dull area.  There is a muddy track winds
through the park, placed beside the path are a couple of small wooden
benches, the aged paint upon the woodwork has started to flake away.  The
track forks at this point, the southern path leads to a small building made
of wood and stone built on the edge of the park grounds.  The eastern path
leads to a large brick wall, approximately six feet high has been built
along the east edge of the park.  A tall iron gateway painted black appears
to be the only opening though the wall; the gaps between the metal bars
reveal a long road overlooked by rundown buildings.

This vast area of grayish green grass may be considered as a park in

wasteland.  Cutting through the grass is a narrow muddy track, which in damp
weather conditions would probably be more like a swamp that a reliable
thoroughfare.  Placed beside the path are a few wooden benches, the aged
paint upon the seats has started to flake away.  Dotted around this vast
sprawl of rough grass are a few trees, shrubs and flowers added for
aesthetic purposes.  A rundown wooden shack overgrown with vines of ivy can
be seen a short distance way to the north although from this point in the

Standing out like a sore thumb within the park is a strange wooden shack
that looks rickety and old.  Although many of the buildings within Mindea
can be considered as rundown, this construction appears to be at the far end
of the scale, the shack looks like it is poised on the brink of collapse. 
Somehow someone has managed to tile the roof of the building with gray slate
without causing the building to collapse under the weight.  Thick twines of
ivy grow up the sides of the building, so many in fact one could be mistaken
that these plants are the only things supporting the structure of the
building.  Around the building is a large sprawl of rough grass with a few
trees, shrubs and flowers added in for aesthetic purposes.

just a couple of apple trees and perhaps even the occasional plum tree. 
There are also a few fruit bearing brambles and bushes growing at the far

The ground which is particularly waterlogged in this area of the park has
been formed into a deep circular pond; the symmetrical shape of the pond
would contradict any claim that this was a naturally occurring body of
water.  Just visible at the water's surface is a rusty iron grate where
water is flowing out of the pond rather than into it.  With no other visible
sources of water replenishing the pond, this suggests that this rather
strange little pond was built to restrict the flow of an underground spring
that has surfaced at this point.  Or at least that is what the little brass
plaque fixed to a small wooden sign post conveniently placed beside the pond
says.

This drain is a cylindrical tunnel which is three feet in diameter, built
from brick and seems to be on the brink of collapse.  The main source of
water that fills the tunnel to a depth of about an inch or two appears to be
coming from a rusty iron grate in the ceiling.  The water flowing through
the tunnel is relatively clean and so it is unlikely that this area is a
sewer.  A wall blocks the east end of the tunnel whereas the west end has
been left open to allow water to pour out.  The water table may not have
been so high when this drain was built but trickles of water now pour
through between gaps in the brickwork, even some masonry has been pushed out
of the tunnel walls revealing a mixture thick waterlogged soil and stone.

This is not a natural stream; the sides of this ditch are too steep and
symmetrical to be anything other than man-made.  The ditch is probably used
to channel water away from the town after heavy rainfall.  The slope of the
floor of the ditch decreases gradually to the north where the level of the
water becomes deeper although the width of the ditch is quite narrow.  There
is a lot of rocky sediment at the bottom of the ditch and the pieces of
stone become gradually smaller downstream.  Nature has helped in part of the
formation of this channel as water seeps into the ditch through gaps between
the rocks that have been piled up to reinforce the sides of the ditch.  Most
of the water however comes from a brickwork tunnel built into the east face
of the ditch.

This ditch was constructed to carry water away from the decrepit town
built above, probably in readiness for times of high rainfall and flooding. 
A stone bridge crosses the ditch and about six feet of land either side of
it, overhanging the surface of the water by approximately three to four
feet.  The water within the narrow ditch is quite deep the current is quite
slow at this point probably due to the low gradient of the land.  Upstream
on the south side of the bridge large rocks and dirt have been used to build
up the sides of the ditch.  On the north side of the bridge the ditch has
been widened out; the water flowing downstream suddenly disappears over a
steep step cut into the ground.

This deep stream flows northwards an open area of gently sloping land
that becomes gradually marshier to the north.  A few patches of grayish
green grass grow here but it is weeds and brambles that dominate the
landscape.  Beyond a few scattered clumps of trees and bushes to the south
is a rundown town.  Directly to the south upstream is an arcing stone bridge
that crosses a man-made ditch with ivy-covered stone walls forming the sides
of the bridge.  Water pours down a stone step just a few feet away from the
north side of the bridge, forming a small bubbling waterfall.  This does not
appear to be the main source of water for this stream as other smaller yet
seemingly naturally occurring channels of water join to this stream at this

grown with rushes and reeds beyond which grows coarse gray-green grass in
thick clumps amidst the mud.  Much of the soil around the base of the hills
has been eroded away to reveal the soft grayish white rock underneath that
forms the channel in which the stream flows.

formed from the erosion and break up of part of a layer of soft
grayish-white rock leaving the rest of the more durable rock structure
behind, forming a tunnel between the two grassy hills.  The sound of running
water echoes out of the mouth of the tunnel, suggesting that it may be the
beginnings of a large underground system, perhaps more tunnels or even
caverns may be found within the darkness.

This appears to be a particularly wide section of tunnel that has been

to the south; the current follows a sharp bend in the main tunnel and
disappears into the darkness to the east.  The water is churned up by large
fragments of rocks that sit on the bed of the stream; they are probably
debris from minor cave-ins within this tunnel.  There are of course other
smaller and narrower tunnels joining onto this main section; the rock
structure resembles holey cheese.

floor of the cavern slopes steeply upwards where to the north parts of the
floor of the cavern are above water level.  The water flows into this
underground section from the west and heads eastwards until it collides into
the eastern wall of the cavern.  Part of the wall of the cavern is made up
by a pile of rocky debris, through a few gaps between the rocks a dark
tunnel can be seen on the other side.  Water obviously must be seeping out
through this tunnel, probably through the gaps between the rocks that form
the blockage in the tunnel or else the cavern would be completely submerged.

Although the current does not appear to be very strong, the water does
look to be very deep although he dark rock of the bed of the stream may make
the stream look deeper than it really is.  The rock that makes up the walls
and the ceiling of the cavern is grayish white and feels quite soft and easy
to scratch away.  Long stalactites hang from the ceiling of the cavern over
both the ledge and the stream, but if there were once stalagmites beneath
these rock formations, they probably have been broken up a long time ago by
the flow of water from the stream.

within the tunnel is deathly still, not even a tiny draught flows through
the rock complex or at least one can not be felt at this point within the
tunnel.  The rock walls of the narrow tunnel look and feel quite smooth and
in small shallow dips in the floor, small puddles of water have accumulated.

{DA Small Cavern{x~
His is a small cavern that has formed from peculiar grayish white rock
which is comparatively soft.  The air within this cavern feels damp and
muggy; the rocky walls glisten with moisture.  Within this cavern is an
almost surreal stalagmite and stalactite structure, appearing almost like
the jaws of a wolf.  Tiny trickles of water flow down small channels
engraved into the rocky floor around the stalagmites.  A long narrow tunnel
leads off eastwards although its final destination remains under the cover
of darkness.  In the distance the sound of dripping water echoes within the
shadows.

This is a small cavern mostly comprised of soft grayish-white rock. 
Numerous stalactites hang from the ceiling of the cave like icicles forever
frozen in time just on the brink of falling.  The stalagmites beneath them
are equally impressive and make negotiating a path around this cave more
like an obstacle course.  Echoing throughout the dark circular cavern are
the soft slow dripping noises of water as the trickle down the stalactites
before meeting their inevitable end upon the cavern floor beneath them.  The
floor also seems to be a collection point for pile of what appear to be
bats' droppings; somewhere high above on the cavern ceiling bats are
roosting.

There does not appear to be anything special within the southwestern
corner of the small cavern, no hidden smugglers' booty or nest of
Darkfriends lurking within the darkness.  There are however many stalactites
hanging from the ceiling of the cave almost mirrored by stalagmites jutting
out from the cavern floor.  The cavern appears to have formed from soft
white rock; small channels of water coursing their way along the cavern
floor suggest how the cavern was made.  In the dark shadowy depths of the
cave an eerie sound of dripping water can be heard echoing throughout.

The southeastern corner of the small cavern holds a deep pool of water
that has accumulated in a smooth dip in the grayish white rocky floor.  The
pool is surrounded by tall stalagmites although parts of the bases of these
tall rock structures appear to have been eroded slightly, perhaps by the
water within the pool.  Overhanging the pool of water are long stalactites,
water slowly trickles down their smooth and glistening rocky surfaced before
finally falling downwards, feeing the pool beneath them; the sound of water
dripping echoes ominously throughout the darkness of these caverns and

parts of the floor appear to have been eroded away to reveal a much darker
and harder rock than what makes up the walls of the tunnel.  The air too
feels moist; the sound of running water coming from the southern end of the

This is a fork in the network of narrow passageways that have formed
underground from mainly soft, grayish white rock.  Erosion, probably by
water passing through this network of tunnels has made the walls smooth. 
The air within these tunnels is deathly cold and damp too, despite there
does not appear to be any draughts here.  Within the darkness there is a
sound of water dripping slowly, it almost seems musical; almost chime like
as the drips echo throughout the darkness.  Somewhere in the distance there
appears to be the sound of running water although it is difficult to gauge
from the sound how strong this current may be for these tunnels seem to
amplify even the slightest of sounds within them.

This was probably once a very long and narrow underground tunnel formed
from grayish white rock.  It may continue for a considerable distance to the
east but the way westwards is barred by a cave-in.  A pile of rubble, mostly
consisting of large pieces of the same grayish white rock that forms the
tunnel, but also other darker colored rock material has formed an
impenetrable wall barring the way ahead.  There is nothing but darkness to
be seen through the gaps between some of the larger boulders that have piled
up here; what lies beyond the wall of rock cannot be seen from here.

the shadows that lie to the south.  The rock is grayish white in color and
feels comparatively soft and easy to scratch.  It appears that the surface
of the rock has been worn down over the years by water, the surface is
smooth almost as if it was polished.  There is a slow constant sound of
water dripping that echoes within the darkness although just audible from
this point, perhaps amplified by the rock structure itself is the sound of

Grayish white rock forms the majority of the cave's structure.  At first
glance this cave looks quite small; it is roughly oval in shape.  A few
short stalactites hang from the ceiling of the cave, together with their
corresponding stalagmites that jut out from the floor beneath them the cave
resembles an animal's mouth with sharp teeth.  The floor of the cave is wet
with small pools of water accumulating in dips in the rocky ground.  Some of
the water accumulated in this cave flows down tiny narrow channels and
groves in the floor towards a rather small hole in the floor in the back of
the cave which is almost hidden by the dark gloomy shadows cast here.  To
the south is the entrance to the cave where trees grow in abundance in an
area of woodlands close by.

that appears to be more like a tangled maze of trees and thorny brambles. 
The ground is quite slippery around this area; it is covered in a lot of
decaying vegetative matter.  The northern boundary of the woods is clearly
marked out by the almost sudden rocky rise to the north; pale gray rock
forms the majority of the structure.  There are faint traces of an old

This little sprawl of woodland can hardly be called one of the great
forests of the land.  The place is a tangled maze of brambles and briars
that have built up around the great deciduous trees that grow here.  Strange
eerie shadows cast by the gnarled old trees and overgrown vegetation does
not make this place the most welcoming of sites within Murandy.  The ground
feels very muddy and slippery; parts of the ground appear to be water logged
although the only signs of a source of water around these parts are the
faint sound of running water somewhere to the south.

up the hill until the top where there appears to be an area of woodland

Southwards there appears to be no trees although a few areas of prickly

Tall rushes and reeds grow along the side of the stream; a couple of nests,
probably belonging to ducks can be seen amongst the vegetation that grows
along the bank.  The gradient of the ground increases further away from the
stream towards the north where a few trees can be seen growing along the

to be a town that consists of tall wooden buildings, or at least from this
point it seems to be.

look decrepit and run down, little care has been taken to preserve them. 
The stream that divides this land from the town is deep yet it is hardly
wide enough to be considered as a river and probably does not feature on any
maps unless they are of the local area.  On both sides of the stream the
embankments are over grown with rushes and reeds beyond which grows coarse
gray-green grass in thick clumps amidst the mud.  The ground to the north of
the stream slopes steeply upwards and in the distance a few young trees can
be seen that have taken root upon the side of the slope.

to bushes and brambles nearer the bottom of the incline.  The slope
overlooks a small river to the south, or what could be more accurately
described as a stream.

something unusual afoot.  A mixture of tall shadowy trees amidst a tangle of

The name Coralle Park is very misleading; this patch of grayish green
grass certainly does not seem fit to bear the name of a monarch.  This point
however appears to be one of the prettier landmarks within the park.  The
ground generally slopes downwards from the south where a few yew trees and
shrubs grow along the park's waist-high perimeter fence.  Down the slope
trickles a very shallow stream which splits the park's dirt track path in
two, the contour of the ground suggests that this once was a much bigger
body of water in the past but now much of the original waterway is covered
in grass and reeds.  Placed along the sides of the stream marking out its
edges are large white and beige pebbles which form a neat alternating
pattern of color.

Perhaps it was once a village green and over time as the town of Mindea
just grew around it?  There are remnants of a recent celebration that has
occurred within this corner of the park; the grass has been slightly churned
up with mud showing numerous footprints embedded deep into the ground's
surface.  Most of the footprints appear to form a circle around a tall
wooden pole which is at least twelve feet in height; the once colorful
ribbons that drape from the top of the pole to the ground look dirty and
faded.  A dirt track path which appears to wind its way through the whole of

their somber yet decorative use in the park is probably outweigh by their
usefulness in making bows; at least two yew trees have been cut down
recently and have been replaced with new saplings growing nearby their
predecessors.  A dirt track winds its way around the park, past a few wooden

is little more than a wide wooden platform supported by wooden support beams
which also form each stall enclosure.  The south end of the platform has
been roped off, which is of little defense against the bales of hay if they
topple over.  A huge set of double doors set on the south side of the stable
leads out outside.

{yThe Stable{x~
The stable is a very large building, a reminder that the town of Mindea
is built upon the patronage of merchants and traders who pass through the
town.  Numerous large stalls have been built along the north side of the
neatly kept building to house horses.  A long wide walkway runs past the
front of the stalls, eastwards towards the opposite end of the long
rectangular building where the main exit is.  The overall area is pretty
dark and gloomy; a few metal hooks have been fixed into the wooden walls to
hold lanterns.  Within the shadows above the stalls is what appears to be a
wooden platform can be seen, bales of hay and straw balanced precariously
along the platform's edge.

This is a large stretch of open ground that lies along the northern side
of Western Road, a very long thoroughfare that leads east/west through
Mindea.  Parked in large tightly packed clusters around the open muddy area
are a large number of merchants' wagons which appear to be under the
constant surveillance of guards.  There are two large buildings that lie
next to each other along the northern edge of this wagon park; the one to
the west is a large inn painted in sickly green and yellow tones whilst the
one to the east a strong stench of horses originates from the stable that
lie there.

This is a huge stretch of open ground that lies along the north side of
Western Road, just in front of a large inn that has been painted in ghastly
shades of green and yellow.  Although there appears to be a side entrance
into the gaudily painted inn on the western edge of the area, the main
doorway that is clearly marked with a large sign hanging above it lies to
the north.  Within this open muddy area itself, there are a large number of
merchants' wagons that have been parked here and are under the constant
surveillance of guards; perhaps their owners are inside the inn?

their vehicles which carries on to the east.  The area lies along the south
side of the Lugard Road, just in front of a large, run down inn; a battered
old sign hanging above the front door names the inn as "The Golden Fox". 
The majority of the building has been constructed from wood that has been
painted in a gruesome combination of red, yellow and green; much of the
paintwork is old, faded and in many places is just simply flaking off the
wood.  There are parts of the building that has been constructed from brick

{yThe Stable Yard{x~
The area of muddy land was probably once part of a stable yard, but now
merchants and traders have literally taken over the plot of land by parking
their carts and wagons tightly together in this area, leaving very little
room to maneuver.  The ground lies just south of a long, wide road that runs
east/west past old wooden buildings, quite similar to the gaudy red, green
and yellow painted one that lies to the south, the only exception is that
the buildings on the north side of the road have mainly been painted with
whitewash.  A rundown wooden building which serves as horse stables can be
seen to the east; the stench of horses coming from that building is almost
overpowering even from this point.

This is just a large area of muddy ground that lies between two
buildings.  Marking the eastern boundary of the area is a large rough wooden
building which resembles an overgrown shed.  A long wooden railing has been
placed near the building, used to tether horses.  The building on the west
side of the area contrasts greatly from its neighbor.  It appears to be an
inn or a tavern that has been constructed mainly from wood that has been
painted in a striking mixture of red, yellow and green.  There are parts of
the building that has been constructed from brick and stone and the roof has
been tiled in dark gray slate.  A lot of the paintwork upon the doors and

Here lies are large area of bare muddy ground that stretches parallel to
a long dusty road nearby to the north.  Within this plot of land numerous
carts and wagons have been stored, tightly parked together in neat rows. 
They probably belong to the merchants and traders as most of these vehicles
are supervised by well armed guards which is more than what any local
farmers would probably do with their carts.  On the south side of the plot
of land is a large building constructed from stone, brick and wood.  Much of
the window frames and even the main entranceway into the building have been
painted in a combination of blue, yellow and red.  A second, much plainer
wooden building that serves as a stable can be seen to the east across the

This is a large area of bare muddy ground that stretches eastwards
parallel to a long dusty road that lies just to the north past a wooden
fence.  Arranged in neat rows long this plot are large carts and wagons that
belong to merchants and traders traveling through Mindea.  Occasionally from
amongst the wagons, an armed guard or two can be seen supervising their
masters' cargoes.  On the south side of the plot of land is a large building
constructed from stone, brick and wood.  Much of the window frames of the

A few large wagons have been parked on this large plot of muddy ground
but most of the area appears to be used as stable yard for the horse stables
that have been built on the eastern edge of the ground.  A couple of sturdy
dhurrans can be seen tethered to a railing outside the large wooden
structure; the horses appear completely oblivious to the noisy hustle and
bustle of work going on around them.  To the west there are more wagons to
be seen parked; perhaps their owners are within the rather garishly painted
inn that lies on the south side of the muddy ground?

This old, large wooden shack-like building is used as a stable.  Although
the muddy floor seems wet as if someone has recently cleaned the building,
the floor is strewn with bits of straw and hay making the air dusty.  The
low rafters of the building seem to be a popular gathering place for spiders
for there are a lot of cobwebs hanging from them.  A smell of horses lingers
in the air which is of no surprise.  Along the east side of the long
building are stalls used to accommodate horses, a few of the stalls appear
to be currently occupied.  Outside each occupied stall hang each respective
horse's equipment.

it looks like it has seen too many years of use.  The stable is old, rickety
and there are quite a few odd looking wooden patches that have been used to
fix holes in the walls.  A draught within the stable stirs up the loose
pieces of hay, straw and dust giving the area a rather musty smell added to
the odor of horses in it.  Built along the east side of the building are
several stalls which are used to house horses.  High above the stalls is a
wide yet rickety looking platform used to store bales of hay and straw where
strange noises can be heard from amongst the shadows there.

This horse stable is a rather old and rickety wooden building used to
store horses.  There are faint glimmers of light filter through the gaps of
a large wooden door on the west side of this long building.  Along the east
side of the building are large horse stalls; dust and straw float in the
air, kicked up by the stalls' occupants.  A few items of equipment hang from
pegs outside each stall although nothing that appears to be of any value. 
Within the darkness above ancient wooden rafters creak and groan as is
something heavy is moving across them, perhaps indicating there could be a
hayloft up there.

This large wooden building appears to have been split into two sections. 
The first section is a simple walkway running the entire length of the west
side of the building.  The floor has been left bare dirt although straw from
large horse stalls that lie on the east side of the building connected by
this walkway has got onto the path.  There does not appear to be anything
out of the ordinary about the horse stalls; they just seem dirty and smelly
from lack of cleaning.  Strange echoing sounds can be heard within the
darkness above the walkway and the horse stalls.  A bare wooden ceiling
supported by thick timber rafters can be seen above; the source of the
sounds appears to be coming from beyond that partition.

building, and just in front of that a wooden railing has been fixed to hitch
horses to.  The stable is quite long even goes beyond the tall brick wall
that has been built along the southern side of the stable yard.  A tall iron
gateway appears to be the only link between the yard and the area lying
beyond the wall.  A second building has been built along the west side of
the yard, this building has been mostly constructed from brick, stone and
roofed with dark gray slate tiles.  Unlike most of the buildings in Mindea,
this one is in a very good state of repair.

The stable is a long wide building that has been made from brick and
timber with partitioned stalls built along its east side.  What appears to
be an extra-large stall in the northeast corner of the room is in fact any
area reserved for tack.  There are other items hidden about the place but a
faint squeaking noise within the shadows of that area suggests that
trespassers will be bitten.  The high domed roof that is thatched can be
seen through the thick cobwebs that shroud the rafters above.  Netting made
from rope has been used to hold up and secure bales of hay and straw from
the rafters, little regard for safety has been taken.  Further south there
are more stalls with probably more surprises lying within them.

Propped up next to the north wall are several wooden racks that contain
various wooden training weapons although few seem to be intact although in

A finely crafted writing stand complete with an inkwell sits on the desk.  A

This is the southern end of a large common room belonging to the Crown
and Scepter Inn.  The first impression one may perceive from seeing this
room is that perhaps a colorblind Tinker has decorated this inn; much of the
woodwork from the skirting boards, window and door frames and wooden support
beams have been painted in a nauseating combination of bright green and
yellow.  The wooden floorboards stained and sticky from spilt wine and ale
so it is of little surprise that the whole room is filled with a sickly
smell of sour wine and heavy tabac smoke.  The plain whitewashed walls of
the room have been stained from years of tabac smoke whilst deep scuff marks
along the walls and floors of the common room appear to be remnants from
heavy barroom brawls.

This is the northern end of a large rectangular common room belonging to
the Crown and Scepter Inn, a not so royal place in Mindea.  As with the rest
of this rundown place, the room has been decorated in a combination of
bright yellow and green.  The floor of this common room could be used as
flypaper; it is extremely sticky from spilt wine and ale that has been left
to dry upon the wooden boards.  The plain whitewashed walls of the room have
taken up an interesting shade of grayish cream from all the years of tabac
being smoked in this room.  Perhaps the most desirable feature of this
common room is the doorway on the western side of the room; it is always
advisable to know where the nearest exits are in a rough establishment like
this.

This vast square shaped room serves as the common room of the Golden Fox.
Within this room the only wood that has escaped being coated in red, yellow
and green paint appear to be the tables and chairs that have been arranged
in round a small stage set in the southwest corner of the room.  Part of the
west wall including the huge fireplace used to warm the room has been
constructed partially from brick and stone for obvious reasons whereas the
rest of the room is built from Murandy's not-so-finest timber.  The constant
rattling of the window shutters as the wind catches them would probably be

This is the western end of the Red Bull Inn's common room.  It is a
simple building constructed from mainly brick and timber with much of the
woodwork decorated with red or white paint.  The wooden floorboards are
stained and sticky from spilt wine and ale, and fills with a sickly smell of
sour wine and heavy tabac smoke.  The plain whitewashed walls of the room
have been stained from years of tabac smoke whilst deep scuff marks along
the walls and floors of the common room appear to be remnants from heavy
barroom brawls.  There are several doorways leading out of the common room
including a small doorway to the south and a much larger on the west side of
the room.

{rThe Common Room{x~
This is the western end of a large common room constructed from mainly
brick and timber with much of the woodwork decorated with red and white
paint.  The plain whitewashed walls of the room have been stained from years
of tabac smoke whilst deep scuff marks mar the floor.  On the north side of
the room is a large fireplace constructed from brownish-red stone.  Along
the east side of the room is the bar, a long counter complete with a hinged
gateway at one end to allow the staff through.  On the wall behind the bar
are several shelves that have been filled with tankards, goblets and
bottles.  Propped up upon the southern end of the counter are several casks
that brandy and other spirits.

When compared with the standards of inns and taverns within the town, the
Folly Inn is probably one of the most respectable and of course expensive
inns within Mindea.  Despite it's rather over grand reputation this place is
still a flea pit when compared with inns outside the town.  Decorated in
blue, red and yellow paintwork, this inn is rather reminiscent of a Tinker's
wagon, although much of the paintwork has flaked off with age.  The air
within the common room smells very strongly of old tabac smoke and soured
wine, a rather nauseating combination to some people.  At this end of the
room there are three brightly painted doorways leading out of the room.  At
the opposite side of the room the bar can be seen.

This is the western end of the Folly Inn's common room.  Much of the
woodwork within this room has been painted in a strange combination of red,
blue and yellow although the walls have been left bare.  A counter has been
built across the west side of the room, a small hatch way has been built
into the counter to allow staff access behind it.  Several shelves have been
fixed upon the wall behind the counter with each shelf holds a tidy display
of bottles, tankards and goblets.  Just visible are several barrels have
been placed upon the floor behind the counter; each one probably contains
some form of alcoholic beverage.  A gray stone fireplace has been built into
the north wall; several brightly polished horse brasses have been hung above
the mantelpiece for decoration.

This dusty old place is just a small dark room being used as a storage
room.  There is not much to see in this area, a few wooden crates stacked in
the corner of the room whilst a few small barrels and casks have been
stacked at the opposite site.  There are even a few full sacks that have
been left piled up on one side of the room.  There is small narrow window
set in the western wall which has been boarded up; a few small slivers of
light seen through gaps between boards.  There appear to be two exits; one
door set in the north side of the room whilst a similar looking doorway
leads eastwards.

Here lies the grimy kitchen of the Crown and Scepter; a black acrid smoke
filled chamber of horrors.  A thick layer of dirt and grease covers most of
the wooden work surfaces set around the sides of the room whilst the wooden
shelves that hang upon the walls used to house jars caked in dust.  Cupboard
doors with flaking paint hang from rusted hinges as they await their end
unless repairs to them are made.  Most of the smoke appears to be coming
from the spits that hang over a large black stone fireplace at the west side
of the room.  A window near the fireplace overlooks a vegetable garden
belonging to the neighboring house.  Thankfully there are three exits away
from this smoky pit, a door to the east, one to the north and one at the
opposite side of the room to the south.

This is a rather plain and dreary hallway somewhere within the Red Bull
Inn.  The bare wooden floorboards of the passageway have gone dark from dirt
embedded deep within the wood grain.  The equally bare walls of the
passageway are covered in a thin coat of whitewash, which over time has
turned to a shabby gray color.  Along the hallway is a couple of sturdy
looking doorways that mark the entrances into other sections of the inn.  A
faint smell of tabac smoke emanates from one of these doorways at the
northern end of the hall although there are no visible markings upon the
door to indicate where they exit may lead.  A steep yet narrow wooden
staircase leads upwards although where it leads is hidden by shadows.

The kitchen looks quite tidy and well kept with many of the cooking
utensils housed on racks upon the wall whilst the spare pots and pans hang
upon a rack from the ceiling above an oblong table in the center of the
room.  Much of the woodwork within the kitchen including the cupboards,
drawers and shelves has been painted in a combination of red and white. 
Heat radiates into the kitchen from the brownish-red stone fireplace built
in the east wall.  As well as a large meat spit there are a couple of
soot-stained cooking pots and griddles to be seen placed hung over the fire.
A small window in east wall overlooks a small muddy path that leads around
the back of the inn to a large vegetable patch and a small wooden shack that
appears to be used as a shed.

There is not very much to see in this area; just a few large wooden crates

the room are a few large hessian sacks although there are no markings upon
them to give any initial clues to their contents.  Apart from the small
narrow window set in the eastern wall that has been boarded up, the only
exit out of this room appears to be the door to the south.

Rough wooden worktops have been built along the northern western corner
of the room; they are a disgusting sight to behold as they are stained with
congealed grease and blood.  Although most of the room has been built from
wood, part of the north side of the room, the fireplace has been constructed
from brick and stone.  The walls around the fireplace have been blackened by
smoke from the fires used for the roasting spit and stove.  The kitchen
resembles an armory rather than a place where food is prepared; several
racks fixed to the walls display a rusty arsenal of knives, meat cleavers
and other sharp metal implements that would look more at home in the
dungeons beneath the Dome of Truth.

The air within this narrow hallway smells faintly of tabac smoke and
stale ale, the smell may be coming from a nearby room as there does not
appear to be a source here.  Although the walls, floor and ceiling of this
plain old hallway have been left bare wood, the doors and even the narrow
staircase that leads to the upper part of this building has been painted
red, yellow and blue.  A couple of dirty unpolished metal hooks have been
fixed to the walls of this room, big enough to hold small lanterns to
illuminate the passageway.  Very strange ghostly noises can be heard from
above, a faint pitter patting accompanied with high pitched squeaking.

The heart and main focus point of this kitchen is the large stove and
fireplace that has been built on the east side of the room.  Constructed
from gray stone and black iron, the fireplaces is a very impressive sight
indeed, the rest of the kitchen pales into insignificance when compared with
it.  Built along the southern wall is a set of worktops, blue and white
painted cupboards and drawers have been built both below and above them.  At
the center of the room is a large table complete with two long benches which
appear to be a gathering place for the members of staff within the inn. 
Overhanging the table from the ceiling is a large wooden rack upon which a
mass of pots and pans have been hung tidily and out of the way.

The walls and floor of this large and spacious private dining room have
been left bare wood and stone although the woodwork within the room has been
painted in a combination of red, yellow and blue.  There is a large oblong
window built into the northern wall which is framed by thick red curtains;
the window gives a rather undesirable view of a large muddy plot of land
outside used to store wagons and carts.  Fixed upon the wall just above the
window is a small narrow ledge of a shelf which is being used to display a
rather peculiar collection of tiny forest animal figurines.  There are two
obvious exits out of this room, one on the west side of the room and one to
the south; both doors are painted in the same color scheme as the rest of
the woodwork within this room.

This is a long and narrow hallway that continues north through the Crown
and Scepter Inn.  The thick wooden support beams of the building which jut
out from the walls have been painted bright green whilst the walls
themselves may have originally been painted white have now taken up a
distinct creamy yellow color.  The floorboards have been left bare but there
are a few telltale signs of fights within this part of the inn; someone has
unsuccessfully tried to scrub away blood stances off of the wooden floor.  A
few small bunches of dried flowers that hang over doorways seems to be a
vain attempt to remove the sickly smell of wine and stale beer from the
room.  There are several doors that lead away from this area into other
parts of the inn.

section to allow any natural light through.  The corridor, like the majority
of the inn has been decorated in a ghastly mixture of yellow and green; even
the old support timbers of the building have been painted such a bright
shade of green it could be enough to make a Tinker feel nauseous.  The
floorboards of this hall have escaped the curse of being painted and have
been left bare.  Along the corridor at regular intervals are several yellow
painted doors that lead away into other parts of the building.

entranceways into other sections of the inn.  Also placed at set intervals
along the walls of the corridor are hooks used for hanging lanterns; the
wooden wall boards around each hook have been stained sooty black.  Further
down the corridor to the east and to the west there are similar doors

several sturdy doors that mark the entranceways into other sections of the
inn and there are more doors at the other end of the corridor.  Attached
along the walls of the hall are hooks used for hanging lamps; there are
large black sooty patches upon the wooden wall boards near the hooks.  A
cold draught fills the corridor; the breeze appears to be coming from the
gap beneath a door at the very end of the corridor.

Each doorway looks much the same as every other doorway along this narrow

upper level which probably is reserved for guests.  As well as the doors,
the skirting boards, door frames and even the banister of the stairs has
been painted in an eye watering combination of bright green, yellow and red.
The wooden walls and floorboards however have been spared the punishment of
painting although hey have been left bare they look discolored from dirt and
age.  A strong smell of tabac smoke and sour wine drifts in through a gap
underneath one of the doors on the north side of the passageway.

The upper level of the Golden Fox Inn is probably just as dull and dreary
as the floor below it; in fact it looks very similar to the lower floor
which can be seen down the steep staircase that has been built here.  This
passageway is quite bare from floor boards to wooden walls; the exceptions
are the brightly painted skirting boards, doors and door frames that have
been done in a combination of bright red, green and yellow colors.  Even the
wooden staircase has not escaped the paintbrush for its banisters have been
painted in the same combination of bright colors.  Along the narrow corridor
many of these brightly painted doorways can be seen; they probably lead into
the guest rooms.

If it were not for the brightly painted doors and doorframes that can be
seen along the hall this passageway would be a dull and dreary room of bare
wood.  Apart from the paint work there have been no attempts to improve the
looks of the area with any decorating or furnishings.  The many spiders'
webs that hang from the rafters and support beams that can be seen along the
hallway are probably the closest that this hall has ever got to being
decorated.  There are several doorways to be seen along this narrow corridor
that probably lead into the guest rooms of this inn.  The corridor continues
westwards where a steep wooden staircase can be seen leading down to the
lower parts of the inn.

{rThe Hall{x~
This is the southern end of a very long and narrow corridor that runs
though the upper level of the Red Bull Inn.  The wooden floorboards of the
room have been left bare which makes this area seem cooler than it probably
is; the icy draught that floods in from the north adds to the effect.  The
walls of this passageway have also been left bare apart from a thin cover of
whitewash, which over time has turned to a grubby gray color.  Hung upon the
walls of this passageway are several brightly polished oil lanterns, which
are used to illuminate the area.  There are several sturdy looking doorways
that mark the entrances into other sections of the inn along this hallway
although the doors lack any markings to distinguish one room from another
one.

Although the walls, floor and ceiling of this plain old hallway have been
left undecorated, the doors leading into other rooms from here and even the
narrow staircase that leads to the lower part of this building has been
painted red, yellow and blue.  There are a couple of dirty unpolished metal
hooks that have been fixed to the walls of this room, big and sturdy enough
to hold lanterns to help illuminate the passageway.  The hallway is a dark
and sinister place with strange and eerie noises coming from one or more of
the rooms connected to it.  The air within this narrow hallway smells
faintly of tabac smoke and stale ale, the smell may be coming from down the
stairs.

{CThe Hall{x~
The majority of this hallway has been left undecorated; it seems that
only the doors have been graced with a coat of pain although the color
scheme, red, yellow and blue is rather reminiscent of a brightly painted
Tinker's caravan.  Because there are no windows here there is not much light
within this corridor, perhaps the metal hooks fixed to the walls are used to
hold lanterns.  Dark and eerie shadows plus creaky wooden floorboards makes
this section of the building perhaps one of the most unnerving places there
for some.  There is a faint smell of tabac smoke, stale ale and sour wine in
this hallway, carried on a chilly draught originating from the western end
of the passageway.

This is the eastern end of a long and narrow corridor.  The passageway
looks very bare; the only color within this room appears to be the brightly
painted doors, both the walls and floor of this room have been left void of
any decoration.  There are no windows within this hall to help illuminate
it, although some blackened hooks fixed to the bare walls of the hallway
suggest that lamps may be hung from these points and used to light the room.

The garden mainly consisting of leafy green herbs with a few patches of
bright colorful blossoms here and there, some planted in raised flower beds,
others in old wooden buckets, there is even an old tin bath tub in the
southeastern corner of the garden which appears to contain herbs that smell
very strongly of mint.  The perimeter of the garden is neatly and clearly
marked out by short wooden posts, no more than two feet in height.  At the
east side of the garden the fence is broken by a small wooden gate from
which a narrow gravel path winds its way around the garden towards the front
door of the cottage.

{gThe Wisdom's House{x~
This is a rather old yet cozy little cottage located somewhere within the
town of Mindea.  This particular room appears to serve as both the kitchen
and the main living area.  The walls are have been left plain and low timber
beams crossing overhead supporting the upper floor seems to indicate that
this building was not built to cater for anyone tall.  A steep wooden
staircase has been built along the northern wall leading upwards into the
upper level of the cottage.  Built beneath the staircase is a cupboard which
is little more than a cubby hole used to store gardening tools.  A huge
black iron stove sits at the western end of the room whilst along the south
side of the room is several shelves fixed to the wall and a large dresser.

The room may have once in the past been used as a storeroom, now the
goods kept within this dark, damp room are limited to empty crates and
pallets.  The room is thick with dust and cobwebs dangle down from the
wooden rafters like net drapes.  Muddy tracks can be seen across the stone
tiled floor of the old storeroom, a sign of recent activity within this
seemingly deserted room.  A small window set in the eastern wall overlooks a
muddy road outside running north/south through the town; the window is
blocked off by rusty iron bars.  The only exit out of this room is a sturdy
looking doorway on the west side of the room.

An icy chill fills the air of this small, windowless storage room.  The
room is barely a couple of feet wide, the majority of the area is taken up
by the shelves, the overhanging wooden ledges make this room a cramped
little space to be in.  Placed upon the shelves are numerous glass and
stoneware jars as well as other containers, all of them appear to be used
for storing foodstuffs.  Shoved in the corner of the room below the shelves
are a couple of small sacks of flour; holes in the corners of the sacks
suggest that mice, maybe even rats have been gnawing their way through.

This is a small square plot of land that lies in front of a large
building that appears to be a house.  The area has been used to cerate a
small yet beautiful flower garden with colorful flower beds placed around
the perimeter of the garden, only broken by the small gravel path that
passes though the garden, linking the front door of the building with the
main road that passes the house to the west.  At the southeast corner of the
garden a gnarled old apple tree grows, a small wooden bench has been placed
beneath the overhanging boughs of the elderly tree next to the garden path.

This is a long yet narrow corridor that appears to be part of a large
house.  The floorboards have been left bare but dirt accumulated from years
of use has left the wood a grayish brown in color.  The narrow wooden
staircase that leads to the upper levels of this building is a similar sight
to behold; the only attempt at brining any color to them is just a small
brown woolen rug placed at the foot of the stairs.  The walls of the
building have been whitewashed although they have turned a strange shade of
gray; the walls have probably not been reacquainted with a paint brush for
many years.  There are several doorways leading to other parts of the
building from here although what lies beyond them remains to be seen.

be no clues within this room to where these doorways may lead.  A few simple

a large worktop with cupboards and drawers built underneath it.  Above the
worktop hung upon the wall are a couple of wooden racks used to house sharp
knives and other small items.  The south side of the room has been mainly
constructed from brick and stone; it is where the fireplace and black iron
stove is.  There are a couple of tall cupboards placed on the east side of

of neatly folded towels and linen.  In one corner of the room a large tin
bath has been placed, beside the bath is a stool, a scrubbing brush and some
soap although there appears to be no visible source of water within the
room.  A washstand has been placed in another corner of the room; the

in the past and the pieces glued back together again.

in bright colors.  A window on the south side of the room overlooks the
other shabby wooden buildings of the town of Mindea.  Thick yet moth-eaten

At the foot of each bed is a small wooden footlocker and against the west

old, decrepit and in need of repairs.  The window is framed by thick yet
moth-eaten gray curtains so only a small vase of flowers places upon the
window sill shows any attempt to improve the area around the window.

This musty old cellar does not look to be the sort of location to hide a
treasure trove, nor does it look like the gateway to a mystical, magical
place beyond the reaches of time and space.  It is just a large old cellar,
square in shape with a few crates and barrels stacked around the place as if
no one was really bothered exactly where they went; whoever owns this place
is certainly not a person with organization skills.  The only eerie things
about this room apart from the darkness, the cobwebs, thick clouds of dust
and the constant dripping noise of water are the creepy creaking and
groaning sounds originating from the floorboards in the rooms above.

This is the northern corner of a huge square shaped cellar that lies
beneath the Crown and Scepter Inn.  Wooden rafters and extra support beams
set in the walls seem to hold up the wooden ceiling pretty well although the
room echoes with the creaking and groaning of old wooden boards due to
movement in the rooms above.  The cellar is an obstacle course of stacks of
wooden crates, barrels and casks; this particular part of the room is also
home to a miniature mountain of sacks that probably contain foodstuffs. 
Whatever lurks within the bags has certainly attracted the attention of
visitors of the rodent variety; as indicated by the well gnawed items
located around the room.

To those with a lot of imagination this could be a great underground
tomb, perhaps the burial chamber of the High King Artur Hawkwing!  In
reality it is just an old cellar that lies under the Crown and Scepter Inn. 
It is about twenty feet in both width and length and is approximately eight
feet in height from floor to ceiling.  Both the cold dark gray stone walls
and the bare earth floor seem to be damp although there is no visible sign
of any water unless one or more of the many barrels that have been stacked
around this room has been leaking.  Occasionally there are clouds of dust
and ghostly groaning noises come from above as movement within the rooms
above the cellar disturb the ceiling and wooden rafters that hold it up in
place.

The southern corner of the cellar is the home to a lot of dust; cobwebs
as well as stacks of crates and barrels which can be seen elsewhere around
the room.  There is not really much to say about this room; it is square in
shape, approximately twenty feet in width, eight feet in height and appears
to have been constructed by very cheap and work-shy builders.  There is
something about the large cracks in the wooden support beams of this part of
the room that silently screams the phrase "death-trap ".  The only real
thing of interest apart from the crates, boxes and casks that have been
scattered in piles around the cellar is actually what may lie within these
containers.  If the floor of the cellar is anything to go by, the crates
probably contain a lot of rat droppings.

is formed by creaking wooden boards, probably the floorboards of the room
above.  A ladder has been fixed to the northwestern wall leading upwards to
a trapdoor that has been set in the ceiling.  There is not much else of

the ceiling.  Hanging from the rather nearest the door on the west side of
the room upon bent nails are a selection of dirty old cloaks, coats and
wide-brimmed hats; a hat stand lies in pieces in the southwestern corner of
the room seemingly forgotten.  Hung upon the back of the west door from a
wooden peg is a small square mirror in a gilded frame; a single crack
crosses the glass pane at a diagonal slant.  Bare floorboards and bare walls
add to coldness and gloomy feel to these quarters.  In the room there are a
few items of furniture that certainly do not look like the work of a master
craftsman, but more of a master of disaster.

{YThe Innkeeper's Quarters{x~
These quarters are almost empty, there are only a couple of items of
furniture to been seen.  Propped up against the western wall is a small
wardrobe whose doors appear to be hanging precariously from rusty hinges. 
Placed next to the wardrobe is a small bed, unmade and strewn with grimy
gray woolen blankets.  A small wooden chest has been stuffed under the bed
although one corner of the box juts out, revealing the location of the
container.  Tattered and dirty curtains adorn the small window on the east
side of the room; the window overlooks a narrow alley way that passes
between the inn and some other plainer wooden buildings that lie upon the
opposite side.

{yA Private Study{x~
The room is approximately ten feet across and fifteen feet long with two
arched crown glass windows set in the west wall.  The majority of the
woodwork within this room has been painted the same horrible combination of
bright green and yellow as the rest of this inn.  Placed against the
southern wall are three tall bookcases made from varnished pine; housed
within these bookcases are hundreds of dusty old books that fill the entire
shelves.  At the north end of the room is a large fireplace constructed from
a very dark gray stone; a large bronzed bucket has been placed beside the
fire and contains implements such as iron tongs and a poker.  And finally at
the east side of the room is a large doorway that leads out of the study.

A horse's trough looks more pleasant than these baths.  The bathroom is a
simple square room with a gray stone fireplace at the northern end.  Hung
over the fireplace is a large black iron kettle with two large wooden pails
placed next to it used to fill the kettle.  The baths themselves are just
two long tin tubs and behind each tub is a small stool.  The walls of the
bathroom have been left bare whitewash and there is little paint left upon
the bathroom's woodwork.  There are two windows on the east and west sides
of the room, the glass is so dirty it hardly allows any light in.  A couple
of shelves fixed just below these windows each with a pile of rather grubby
looking towels perched upon them.

This is just a small draughty guest room approximately ten feet square. 
Along the south side of the square room two small bedside cabinets sit
either side of a large bed.  The walls and even the floor of the room has
been left bare; the only thing covering the wooden floor boards is a dirty
woolen rug placed in front of a door on the east side of the room.  Against
the opposite side of the room is a small chest of drawers, a battered old
washstand and in the northwest corner of the room is a solitary wooden
stool.  A large rectangular window complete with grubby yellow curtains has
been built into the western wall of the room.

This is a rather dingy little guest room, damp and draughty.  The walls
and even the floor of the room has been left bare wood, no one has really
bothered to decorate this room.  A rectangular window fixed in the eastern
wall overlooks the side wall of a large wooden building nearby the inn. 
Along the south side of the room is a large bed with two small bedside
cabinets sitting on each side of it.  Against the wall on the opposite side
of the room are a small chest of drawers and a battered old wardrobe whilst
a small washstand has been abandoned in the northeast corner of the room. 
The only real thing of value within this room is probably the doorway at the
west side of the room, the exit.

For a guest room this is a particularly uncomfortable place, cold and
draughty.  The room is approximately ten feet square with a large
rectangular window in the west wall and a door leading out on the east side
of the room.  Like the rest of the inn, this room has been decorated in a
gaudy combination of yellow and green, not even the bed and the two bedside
cabinets that sit either side of it have escaped being painted.  Opposite
the bed on the north side of the room there is a rather battered old
wardrobe as well as a washstand.  For some strange reason a plain wooden
chair has been left in the northwest corner of the room although it does not
look too sturdy.

{yA Guest Room{x~
This is a draughty little guest room which could probably serve a more
useful purpose as a dungeon cell for royalty; the inn certainly does not
deserve its name.  The guest room is roughly ten feet square with a
rectangular window in the west wall and a door leading out on the east side
of the room.  The room which has been decorated in green and yellow has only
a few furnishings that are of little value, probably because the guests of
such an establishment would run off even the bed if they could.  As well as
the bed, which has been fixed firmly to the floor on the south side of the
room, there is a wardrobe, writing desk, chair and washstand placed against
the opposite wall.  Both the sickly green curtains and bedspread have a
certain "moth-eaten" look about them.

This is a small guest room that has been decorated in a sickly

The room is approximately ten feet square with a large rectangular window in

complete with a moth-eaten green and yellow patchwork quilt.  Against the

this inn.  The room is almost bare, the ceiling, walls and floor are
complexly void of any decoration.  There are however a tattered pair of
curtains on the window at the northern end of the room although the window
probably does not need curtains for it is far too dirty to see through it. 
A couple of rickety old examples of furniture have been placed in this room,
a bed, a chest of drawers and a small washstand.  Probably anything else
that was placed in this room has been long since stolen.  A painted door on

approaching their final days before they disintegrate.  A bed, table, chair

Although the Red Bull Inn is one of the finer inns within Mindea, this
rundown excuse of a bathroom shows that even this establishment is found
lacking in some departments.  The bathroom is a simple square room with a
small brownish-red stone fireplace built at the western end.  Hung over the
fireplace is a large black iron kettle that is probably used to heat up the
bath water.  The baths themselves are just two long tin tubs that are dented
out of shape in some places.  A layer of filth across the window at the
southern end of the room guarantees the privacy of the occupants of this

olive skin complexion that is typical of the people that live on the coast
of the Sea of Storms.  Her dress is Altaran in style; it is of a very
revealing cut easily rivaling a Domani's.  The color of her dress matches
her eyes, a vibrant blue hue.  The bottom hem of the dress is slightly
raised to reveal several frilly petticoats ranging from snow white to sky
blue.  She wears a cloak that contrasts greatly with her beautiful dress, it
is a cloak covered in multicolored patches.

This is a rather old copy of the Beltine Special of Aiel Girl.  One or
more sad and depraved individuals have produced this small book containing
prints of women supposedly Maidens of the Spear from the Threefold Land in
provocative poses.  It is filth, pure and unadulterated filth involving
spears, veils, oosquai and no cadin'sors.  It is a highly inaccurate account
of Far Dareis Mai life although the sweat tent centrefold has some grain of
truth to it, if only for the nudity.

{yThe City Of Chachin{x~
This is a wide and fairly well travelled road.  In the distance to the
east lies Chachin, the capital city of Kandor.  It is a huge fortified city
built upon mountains with three hulking walls encompassing it.  Each wall is
bristling with watchtowers that overlook both the lands outside of the walls
and within them.  The three highest peaks within Chachin are almost a mile
in height, even with the peaks sheared off.  Built upon the tallest peak at
the center of the city is the Aesdaishar Palace, home of the ruling monarch
of Kandor.

{yThe Bridge Of Sunset{x~
Three colossal walls surround the city of Chachin; each wall is bristling
with watchtowers that overlook both the lands outside of the walls and the
city within them.  Surrounding the outer wall of the city is an enormous dry
moat with a forest of razor sharp steel spikes, roughly six feet in height
lining the bottom.  There are twenty-four retractable bridges that span
across the dry moat to provide access into the city.  The Bridge of Sunset
is one such bridge with a hulking gray stone fortress at its mouth.  Beyond
the gigantic reinforced gate to the east are the outer districts of Chachin.

to the west is Maradon Gate, one of the heavily fortified gates that provide
access in and out of the city.  The area is overlooked from above by huge
gray stone battlements and towers.  A wide thoroughfare known as Maradon
Road leads away to the east through one of the commercial districts of the
city.

Maradon Road is the main thoroughfare that leads from the center of

outer and middle city wall so it is not city proper by law.  There is some
wear and tear visible upon the paving slabs used in the construction of the
road which is probably due to the high weight of traffic that use it.  The
road is overlooked by several small buildings but they seem to be shops.  A
second road intersects Maradon Road to the north whilst to the west lies a
small plaza.

Maradon Square intersects the Maradon Road as it passes through the inner
city area of Chachin.  The area has been paved with dull gray flagstones a
shade lighter than the stone used to construct the city walls.  Numerous
shops and houses border Maradon Square which is in turn overlooked by the
middle city wall.  Two large gates situated on the northern and western
sides of the square provide access through the city wall into the outer
districts of Chachin.  To the south there is a wide thoroughfare leading

{yShol Arbela Road{x~
Shol Arbela Road is the main road that leads from the center of Chachin
to Shol Arbela Gate.  This section of the road goes through the area of
Chachin that lies between the middle and the inner city wall.  It is one of
the more prosperous districts within Chachin; there are many shops and
houses belonging to merchants and traders along the road.  There is some
wear and tear visible upon the paving slabs used to construct the road which
can probably be attributed to the high levels of traffic that use this road.

Shol Arbela Square intersects the Shol Arbela Road as it passes through
the inner city area of Chachin.  The area has been paved with dull gray
flagstones a shade lighter than the stone used to construct the city walls.

overlooked by the middle city wall.  Two large gates situated on the
northern and eastern sides of the square provide access through the city
wall into the outer districts of Chachin.  To the south there is a wide

{yHama Bridge{x~
Three colossal walls surround the city of Chachin; each wall is bristling
with watchtowers that overlook both the lands outside of the walls and the
city within them.  Surrounding the outer wall of the city is a vast dry moat
with a forest of razor sharp steel spikes, about six feet in height lining
the bottom.  There are two dozen retractable bridges that span across the
moat to provide access into the city.  Hama Bridge is one such bridge with a
huge gray stone fortress at its mouth.  Beyond the gigantic reinforced gate
to the north are the outer districts of Chachin.

{yThe City Of Chachin{x~
This is a wide and fairly well travelled road.  In the distance to the
north lies Chachin, the capital city of Kandor.  It is a massive fortified
city built upon mountains with three enormous walls surrounding it.  Each
wall is bristling with towers that overlook both the lands outside of the
walls and within them.  The three highest peaks within Chachin are almost a
mile in height, even with the peaks sheared off.  Built upon the highest
peak at the center of the city is the Aesdaishar Palace, home of the ruling
monarch of Kandor.

This is a rather old house located somewhere within the outer city of
Chachin.  This particular room appears to serve as both the main living area
and the kitchen.  The plaster walls have been recently whitewashed and have
been adorned with several framed pictures, mainly paintings.  A steep wooden
staircase has been built along the eastern wall leading upwards into the
upper level of the house and built beneath the staircase is a cupboard.  A
small stove sits at the northern end of the room whilst along the western
side of the room are several shelves fixed to the wall and a large dresser. 
A small round table encircled by chairs stands at the center of the room.

{BJaramide Crescent Bakery{x~
Like many of the buildings within this area this bakery has been built
from dull gray stone with additional support from thick wooden timbers. 
This room has been split into two by a tall wooden counter.  A display of
wares on sale sits upon trays on wooden shelves along the northern wall of
the room behind the wooden counter; products ranging from loaves of bread to
pies and cakes can be seen here.  A small door almost hidden from view can
be seen built into the north wall although there are no markings visible to
give any clues to what lies behind it.  There is a large window on southern
side of the room overlooks a long paved street, at the opposite side of the
street more shops and houses can be seen.  Finally, there is a door next to
the window that leads out to Jaramide Crescent.

{BA Bowyer's Shop{x~
A draught from underneath the main door on the southern side of the room
stirs up a multicolored cloud of feathers across the floor.  The shop is
small and much of the space has been taken up by a wooden counter situated
at the northern end of the room, a few paces in front of a second door.  A
selection of unstrung bows stand in a rack that has been fixed upon the
northern wall, they all appear to be rather plain and do not warrant a seal
of master craftsmanship.  In the southwest corner of the room underneath a
large barred window are several wooden casks, once used to store spirits,
now their lids have been removed and they are being used to store arrows.

{BA Cobbler's Shop{x~
A strong aroma of leather fills the air of this small yet quaint
cobbler's workshop.  On the south side of the room next to the entrance in
to the building is a large window that has been used to display various
items of the shop owner's work ranging from sturdy work boots to dainty
slippers.  Although none of the items on display appear to be the work of a
master craftsman they do actually appear to be well made.  The north side of
the room has been taken up mainly rolls of material including leather and
velvet used in the manufacture of shoes.  The rest of the room is taken up
by a large workbench at the center of the room where bits and pieces of
leather partially forming the cobbler's next creation lay amongst scattered
tools.  The rest of the cobbler's tools have been stored neatly in racks
that hang upon the walls.

This is a rather small hat shop whose customers are probably mainly the
merchants, traders and minor nobles that pass through the city of Chachin. 
On the northern side of the room next to the doorway leading out of the shop
is a large window that overlooks Maradon Road.  Placed on stands upon wooden
shelves next to the window are large displays of hats; although they are
mostly Kandori, there are a few examples of other Borderlander styles. 
There are larger displays on the east and west sides of the shop, including
Taraboner conical hats and a few Cairhienin bell-shaped caps.  There is a
large wooden counter on the southern side of the room where the shopkeeper
probably does their transactions or just stands there to look important.

kitchen and the main living area.  The walls are have been left bare plaster
and the low timber beams crossing overhead supporting the upper floor seems
to indicate that this building was not built to cater for anyone tall.  A
steep wooden staircase has been built along the northern wall leading
upwards into the upper level of the house and built beneath the staircase is
a cupboard.  A large blackened stove sits at the western end of the room
whilst along the southern side of the room are several shelves fixed to the

{CThe Saldaean Wench{x~
This tavern is most likely one of the roughest establishments in the city
of Chachin.  The common room of the Saldaean Wench is large rectangular
room, lit up by oil lanterns that hang from the ceiling.  The walls have
been left bare, revealing the red brick and timber that were used in the
tavern's assembly.  A thin dusting of wood shavings across the floorboards
reveals a poor attempt to hide the blood stains from past barroom brawls. 
At one end of the room is a bar and at the opposite side of the room is a
wooden staged used by the entertainers that work here.  Around the common
room are tables and chairs placed in a seemingly chaotic manner; their
unstable appearance is yet another highlight to sloppy workmanship within
this establishment.

wood but it does not appear that the proprietor of this establishment has
bothered to clean it up.  There are numerous wooden shelves displaying the
wares that are on sale fixed to the cold gray stone wall behind the shop
counter.  There are two exits, a large doorway at the western side of the
room leading out to Elsalam Crescent and a much small wooden door that can
be seen on the opposite side of the room behind the shop counter.

establishment are weapons.  A large wooden counter stands at one end of the
room and hung upon the wall behind the counter are several tattered war
banners that almost reach from ceiling to floor.  The best goods seem to be
located in the display cases fixed to the walls, chained and locked for
security reasons.  A small window fitted with wooden shutters provides a
good view of the street outside, next to which lies a door which appears to
be the only visible exit from this shop.

As the name, rather conveniently painted in bright yet gaudy colors upon
a wooden board hung above the shop counter suggests, this is indeed a
chandler's shop.  Much of the smaller and more valuable merchandise has been
placed upon shelves along the western and eastern walls, out of reach from
people of average height.  The small step ladder stuck in the northeast
corner of the room explains how the shopkeeper manages to retrieve items for
their customers.  Placed at the southern end of the room facing the entrance
into the shop is a wooden counter where most of the transactions in this
shop probably occur.

This small armor store is very typical of the shops located within the
outer Chachin districts.  The owner of this establishment has chosen to
display their merchandise in a rather damp and dusty building.  Both the
wooden floorboards and the plaster used to cover the walls have turned a
grubby gray color from dirt and there are signs of rotting in some places. 
A large wooden counter stands at one end of the room; behind the counter
hang several dented shields that have probably seen better days.  There are
a variety of types of armor on display on racks fixed upon the walls
although most of the merchandise within this shop is covered in a thin layer
of dust.  A small window fitted with wooden shutters gives a fine view of
the street outside and the door located next to it provides a convenient
escape route from this store.

This shop is much smaller than the other ones that line Shol Arbela Road,
but that it lacks in size it makes up for in sheer presence.  Through the
jungle of brightly colored blooms that have been placed on display in
containers is a wooden counter where maybe once transactions may of
occurred, but now it too seems to have succumbed to the floral invasion and
is home to a dramatic trail of creeping ivy whose source appears to be a
rather plain old terracotta pot placed at the edge of the counter.  Tendrils
have crept along the wooden rafters but fall short of reaching the brass
lanterns that hang from the ceiling.  Somewhere on the south side of the
shop through the densely growing foliage is the exit.

from ornamental fixtures upon the walls.  A plush dark green carpet covers
the entire floor of this establishment.  There are several desks and chairs
placed along the eastern side of this particular room whilst several
comfortable blue armchairs and a clock have been placed on the opposite

twine are bunches of herbs which have been hung out to dry.  A small stone
fireplace not only provides heat in this drafty establishment but also a
place for the owner to brew and distil their products.  At the back of the
shop is a counter that also serves as a workbench; there are strange tools
and glassware littering the worktop and leaving little room for anything
else.

At a first glance this shop looks empty; the only items that reside upon
the shelves are particles of dust apart from a small set of scales and tiny
weights.  Although the shop window is protected by black iron bars it is
void of any display.  The reason why the shop appears to be so empty becomes
apparent when looking at the center of the room.  Set in the middle of the
room is a large wooden counter upon which a small reinforced cabinet stands.
There is a glass panel in the door of the cabinet behind which is a small
display of jewelry; the majority of the items look like they have been made
from polished brass and cut glass.  Why so much effort has seemingly gone
into protecting these relatively cheap items remains to be seen.

building in the hours of daylight.  This room is the reception, a simple
whitewashed room, decorated proudly with the banners of the City Guard and
the Night Watch.  A large wooden desk stands at the northern end of the
room, behind which the duty guardsman is usually seated.  Also located
behind the desk is a trapdoor, set in the floor of the reception.

This is a long corridor located within the West City Guard headquarters.

the headquarters, each one has mean marked with its own brass plaque sign. 
There are two flights of stairs situated at northern and southern ends of
the corridor; one leads upwards whilst the other leads down.

the south.  The building easily towers over its counterparts within this
district of Chachin but is in turn eclipsed by Aesdaishar Palace to the
north.  This palace's grounds are enclosed by a tall brick wall which is in
turn encompassed by the city walls.  A paved road borderer by ornamental

This tavern is probably one of the roughest establishments in Chachin. 
The common room of the Broken Drum is large rectangular room, lit up by oil
lanterns that hang from the ceiling.  The walls have been left bare,
revealing the mixture of bricks, stone and timber that were used in the
tavern's construction.  A thin layer of wood shavings adorns the floorboards
but they fail to succeed in hiding the blood stains from past barroom
brawls.  At one end of the room is a bar and at the opposite side of the
room is a wooden staged used by the entertainers that work here.  Around the
common room are tables and chairs placed in a seemingly haphazard manner;
their wobbly appearance is yet another highlight to sloppy workmanship
within this establishment.

Although this is a large courtyard it is relatively small in comparison
to the courtyard that can be seen down the paved road to the west.  The
ground has been paved with huge square slabs of pale grey and black stone in
an intriguing checkered pattern.  The area is illuminated by a series of
torches posted around the outskirts of the courtyard and is overlooked by
both the city walls and the towers built along them.  There is a large
stable to the east, the cavalry training grounds to the south, and to the
north is the entrance into the east wing of Chachin Fort.

The East Stable is a huge gray stone building topped with a black slate
roof, used to house some of the cavalry horses of Chachin Fort.  The area is
very tidy and well illuminated.  Within the East Stable are dozens of stalls
for horses and placed on pegs and hooks outside each stall are various items
of riding and grooming equipment for that individual horse.  A hayloft has
been built above the stalls; a rickety wooden ladder fixed to one of the
walls appears to be the only way to access the hayloft.  There appears to be
only one exit out of this building, a large set of doors to the west.

fort is a hub of activity both day and night, in particular the open air
areas within the fort walls such as the two baileys and the training areas. 
There are several tall towers posted along the city walls which may provide
a better view of these areas than from the battlements.  At this point along
the battlements is an iron braced hatchway built into the floor which may
provide a route into the fort.

The outer battlements of Chachin give an excellent view of both the land
outside the walls and the city within.  The city has been built upon three
mountainous peaks, upon the tallest peak stands Aesdaishar Palace which
surpasses any structure in the city.  The defenses outside of the city fort
are clearly visible from this point, a huge dry moat surrounds the city and
two dozen retractable bridges each with a fortress at its mouth provide ways
over the moat.  The lands around the fortified city up to a mile away have
been cleared of any vegetation growing more than a few inches in height.

The outer battlements of Chachin offer a fine view of inside the city and
the land outside of the city walls.  The city has been built upon three
mountainous peaks, upon the highest peak stands Aesdaishar Palace which

crossing the moat.  The area beyond the moat has been cleared of any flora
growing more than a couple of inches in height for up to a mile away.  There
is a large arched doorway leading into one of Chachin outer towers lying

The outer battlements of Chachin provide a good vantage point to observe
both the land outside the walls and the city within.  The city has been
built upon three mountainous peaks, upon the tallest peak stands Aesdaishar
Palace which surpasses any structure in the city.  The defenses outside of
the city fort are visible from this point, there is a massive dry moat
surrounding the city and twenty-four retractable bridges each with a
fortress at its mouth provide ways over the moat.  The area beyond the dry
moat have been cleared of all vegetation growing more than a few inches in
height for up to a mile away.  A large arched doorway leading into one of
Chachin outer towers lies a short distance away to the south.

These quarters are almost bare, there are only a couple of items of
furniture to been seen.  Propped up against the western wall is a small
wardrobe whose doors appear to be hanging precariously from rusty hinges. 
Placed next to the wardrobe is a small bed, unmade and strewn with grimy
gray woolen blankets.  Tattered and dirty curtains adorn the two small
windows on the western side of the room; the windows overlook an alley that
passes between the inn and another stone building.  The windows are far too
small to be considered as a possible exit leaving the wooden door on the
northern side of the room as the only reasonable route out of these sleeping

couple of wooden racks used to house sharp knives and other small items
whilst there are several tall cupboards placed on the opposite side.  Hung
from the ceiling between the old lanterns that illuminate the area are racks
holding dozens of pots and pans.  The focal points however within the

There are several stalls for horses built along the southern side and placed
on pegs and hooks upon the wall facing each stall are various items of horse
riding and grooming equipment.  A hayloft has been built above the stalls; a
rickety wooden ladder fixed to the western wall appears to be the only way
to access the hayloft.  There appears to be only one exit out of this

the floor of this platform barely look able to maintain the weight of the

plain with dark wooden paneling fixed to the lower half of the walls whilst

{yT{Yhe{W King's A{Yrm{ys{x - The Common Room~
This is a large raised wooden platform located at the eastern end of the
large common room belonging to the King's Arms; one of Chachin's finer
drinking establishments.  The room is rather plain with dark wooden paneling
fixed to the lower half of the walls whilst the upper half has been left
bare white plaster.  The room is brightly illuminated by brass lanterns that
hang from the ceiling.  Placed neatly around the room are lots of tables and
chairs, a few of the items of furniture show signs of needing repairs.  A
short flight of steps to the east leads downwards towards the main common
room area.

This is a short corridor within whose walls have been paneled with dark
wood along their bottom halves and covered with white plaster along the
tops.  This area is brightly illuminated by a series of small oil lamps that
have been hung from the ceiling.  The wooden floorboards are old and grimy
from years of use and lack of cleaning.  An equally grimy spiraling wooden
staircase leads to the upper level of the inn.  There are numerous doors
along the corridor although there are no indications from this side to
suggest what lies beyond them.

This is the kitchen of the King's Arms Inn, one of Chachin's larger and
more respectable inns.  The area is illuminated by a series of brass lamps
that hang from the ceiling.  Generally the area looks tidy with many of the
cooking utensils housed in wooden racks upon the wall whilst the spare pots
and pans hang upon a wooden rack from the ceiling.  Below the rack is a
large oblong wooden table, the main focal point of the room for the staff
who work in the kitchen.  Several chairs have been arranged around the
table.  The plain wooden kitchen cupboards, drawers and shelves look as if
they have been recently repaired.  Warmth radiates into the room from the
pale-gray stone fireplace built in the southern wall of the room.  As well
as a large meat spit there are a couple of soot-stained cooking pots and
griddles to be seen placed hung over the fire.

This is a large flagstone courtyard that is flanked by several red brick
buildings and a simple stone wall.  The most significant buildings appear to
be a large stable built along the southern edge of the yard and a grand
structure on the eastern side appears to be an inn or tavern.  There is a
large gray stone wall marking the northern perimeter of the yard; long
twisting vines of ivy have grown up the sides of the wall.  A large archway
appears to be the only way through the wall, beyond the arch a large paved
square can be seen.

This is a simple stable made of red brick and timber.  The area is quite
neat and tidy although a draught running through the building does
occasionally stir up some fragments of straw and hay into the air.  Built
along the southern side of the stable are numerous large stalls that are
used to accommodate any horses.  A long wide walkway runs east/west past the
front of the stalls; the floor of the walkway appears to be packed mud. 
Built above the stalls is a hayloft, which is little more than a wide wooden
platform supported by wooden support beams that also form each stall
enclosure.  There is a large set of double doors set on the northern side of
the building leading out of the stables.

This hayloft is a confined area positioned above the stalls of the
stable.  The area a complete mess; there is plenty of dirt, grime and
cobwebs to be seen as well as loose pieces of straw and hay that have
escaped from the bales that have been stored here.  The rickety wooden
boards used to make the floor of this loft barely look able to maintain the
weight of the bales of straw and hay.  A small hatchway has been cut into
the floor of the loft at the western end of the room and just below the
hatch is a wooden ladder that leads downwards.

This is the Visitors Yard, the huge courtyard where visitors of the
Aesdaishar Palace are greeted before being allowed access to the palace
itself.  Overlooking the grand courtyard to the south is the palace, an
immense structure of sparkling domes and balconies of stone fretwork with
every part of its surface shining in red and green.  To the north is a pair
of great bronzed gates worked with a lacquered Red Horse standing beneath a
red tiled arch that leads out of the Visitors Yard and onto Palace Road, the
main thoroughfare leading into the city.

The Great Hall is a huge square chamber located at the center of the
Aesdaishar Palace.  White marble statues and colorful tapestries line the
walls; the statues mainly depict women with flowers or children playing
while the tapestries display hunting scenes.  The area is brightly lit which
adds to the effect of the sparkling green and red tiled floor that gleams in
the light.  There are several corridors leading off from this point as well
as a double staircase constructed from white stone that leads to the upper
levels of the palace.  The only other exit from this room appears to be the
huge pair of fortified doors to the north.

The Palace Kitchens are large, so huge that it has white stone columns to
help support the ceiling.  The walls of the kitchen have been recently
whitewashed and the off-white tiles that have been used to cover the floor
gleam in the light from where they have been recently scrubbed clean.  The
room is dominated by the three huge stoves and meat spit on the southern
side.  Racks full of pots and pans hang from the ceiling between the bronzed
lanterns that illuminate the area.  Granite topped counters line the eastern
side of the room, above which are numerous cupboards also fixed to the wall.
Dozens more cupboards and drawers can be seen along the opposite side of the
room.  At the center of the room is a large table, surrounded by chairs that
are most likely to be used by the kitchen staff and other servants when
having a break.

This is the center of a long corridor located within Aesdaishar Palace. 
Careful measures have been put into place to ensure that no part of the

dozens of identical doors along the corridor with no markings upon them to
say what lies beyond them.  The only other exit visible from this point is a
spiraling stone staircase leading to the upper levels of the palace.

The corridors in the Aesdaishar Palace are rather unusual when compared
to with Borderlander palaces.  White marble statues and colorful tapestries
line the hallways; the statues mainly depict children playing or women with
flowers while the tapestries depict fields of flowers or nobles in gardens. 
The area is brightly lit which adds to the effect of the sparkling green and
red tiled floor that gleams in the light.  At intervals along the halls,
arched windows look over into the many gardens and flagstone courtyards
belonging to the palace.  There are several red doors along this corridor
but there are no signs to hint at what may lie beyond them.

The area is brightly illuminated which adds to the effect given off by the

the halls, arched windows look over into the many gardens and flagstone
courtyards belonging to the palace.  There are several red doors along this
corridor but there are no signs to hint at what may lie beyond them.

This is one of the many roomy apartments allocated to important visitors
of the Aesdaishar Palace.  This apartment consists of three rooms but the
most significant ones are the sitting room and the bedchamber.  All of the
rooms are decorated with silk tapestries upon golden yellow walls and soft,
flowery carpets.  The bedchamber is huge; a large bed with a feather
mattress large enough to accommodate four or five occupies the room.  On the
north side of the bedchamber is a tall arched window and door that leads out
to a small balcony.  The sitting room is equally as large as the bedchamber;
the furniture within the room is the work of master craftsmen.

This is the northern end of the East Walk, a rather isolated walkway
built along the eastern side of Aesdaishar Palace.  The walkway is roughly
twenty paces wide but it is so long that it makes it tricky to give a good
estimation of its length.  The entire walkway is enclosed by a stone railing
along three of its sides and one of the palace walls along its fourth.  The
walkway offers an amazing view across the city rooftops, a patchwork of
colorfully tiled roofs that sparkle in the sun by day and by lamplight at
night.

{gA{Ges{Wdais{Gha{gr P{Ga{Wla{Gc{ge{x - {GThe Royal Apartments{x~
The hallways within the Aesdaishar Palace are rather unusual when
compared to with Borderlander palaces.  Stunning tapestries and white marble
statues line the corridors; the statues mainly depict children playing or
women with flowers while the tapestries depict fields of flowers or nobles
in gardens.  The area is brightly lit which adds to the gleaming effect of
the green and red tiled floor.  At intervals along the halls, arched windows
look over into the many flagstone courtyards and gardens belonging to the
palace.  There are several green doors along this passageway leading but
there are no signs to suggest what may lie behind each one.

This is one of spacious apartments in the Aesdaishar Palace, resided in
by the Royal Family.  This particular apartment consists of four rooms but
the most significant ones are bedchamber and the sitting room.  All of the
rooms are decked out with beautiful silk tapestries upon ornate flower
carved wall panels and plush, flowery carpets upon the floors.  There are
several gilded armchairs with velvet cushions arranged neatly around the
sitting room.  Beside a green door leading out of the apartment is a small

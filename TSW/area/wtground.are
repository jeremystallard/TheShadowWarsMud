Dressed in {Rred{x and {Ygold{x the High Lord is doing his best to remain out of
sight as he whispers conspiratorially with his fellow High Lord.  The
shadows hide how he looks so that he could only be identified by his house
colors.

librarian woman~
a librarian~
The head librarian works quietly but quickly.
~
This slender woman is almost erratic in movement at times because she
moves so quickly from one place to the next to remain organized with the
books.  Her {yhair{x has been pulled back into a bun but strands have come loose
and so hang down about her face.  Her {Wwhite{x blouse with {Ygold{x trim and long,
{Dblack{x skirt are kept neat.  When she speaks its in hushed tones and those
that speak to loudly too often get a whispered berating.

he is listening to what is going on around him.

A High Lord sits working at his desk.
~
Dressed in his {bho{x{Yu{x{bse{x colors, this High Lord is quietly working at his
desk.  With his {bc{x{Yoa{x{bt{x slung over the chair behind him, he is dressed in just
his {Wshirt{x and {Dbreeches{x.  With his {ybrown{x hair combed and his beard neatly
trimmed, with only hints of grey in both, this man's steely {Bgaze{x flicks over
the parchment infront of him.  Despite living in the lap of luxury the
middle-aged Lord takes time to train and remain fit and healthy.  Beside him
at his desk rests his sword.

A Bakery~
A small bell jingles each time the door opens, alerting the busy bakers. 
The smell of cookies and other sweets fills the room with their delicious
aroma.  Tables and shelves on either side of the room display packages of
goodies that are for sale.  Across the room from the door the counter sits,
behind which another shelf of goodies sits, blocking the view to the kitchen
in the back.  The woman behind the counter offers a smile as she waits to
assist the next customer.

Road to the Stone~
A long winding road weaves its way amoungst the houses of the nobles as
it heads towards the Stone which could almost be considered a mountain in
its height and girth.  People walk to and fro as they go about their
business, many of them the Lords and Ladies that travel along in carriages
or on horseback to keep their feet out of the mud.

An Elegant Home~
The large home is lavishly decorated with all the finery the couple could
afford.  Golden items sit on display shelves all throughout the house as do
paintings.  The large kitchen is set at the back of the house not far from
where the servants all sleep.  The dining room has a large {rmah{x{yog{x{rony{x table
surrounded by chairs.  The parlor is equally just as lavish.  The whole
house speaks of wealth and importance.

The Dungeon~
The dungeon is lit with torches but mostly for the guards that get to sit
down here that have to keep an eye on the prisoners.  They can be heard
further down the hallway talking, the sound of dice can also be heard.

have sunk in a bit.  The hallway continues towards the south where another
{rto{x{Rr{x{rch{x can be seen.

The Captain's Office.~
{DBlack{x lanterns used in the hallways light up the office of the Captain. 
Deep {rred{x carpeting covers the floor, silencing any footsteps.  On the walls
to the east and west are equal sized banners of the various houses of the
High Lords while on the southern wall is a large flag of Tear.  A desk sits
near the back of the room behind which the Captain sits doing paper work. 
Two simple {ywooden{x chairs sit infront of the desk so that those that come in
to see him can sit down.  On a hook near the door hangs a {Dblack{x and {Ygold{x
coat while on a chair not far from the hook a plumed helmet sits.

guard comes off or goes on duty but otherwise remains quiet.  The same {Dblack{x

with {csilken{x sheets and pillows.  On the opposite wall from the cabinet is a

Heart of the Stone~
Surrounded by the forest of {rcolumns{x, the Heart of the Stone echoes with
the sound of your footsteps.  The high dome soars above you but your
attention is immediately drawn to what is suspended mid-air.  A {Wcry{x{Cs{x{Wtal{x
sword slowly revolves in place in the air with its hilt pointed downwards. 
It gives off a light of its own, removing the need for lanterns here.  As
you reach forward to try and touch the sword your hand seems to press up
against some unseen barrier.

A Tiled Courtyard~
The turrets have been hidden with {gvines{x that climb around the wall. 
Benches sit along the walls almost framing the fountain that sits in the
middle of the courtyard.  There is little shade here so the sun is on this

A Mount Shop~
The smell of hay and horses fills the air inside the shop, it eminates
from the stables that reside to the north.  A young man moves forward with a
ready smile and a greeting to the Lords and Ladies that enter the shop to
look into buying a horse.  A young boy assists what looks like his brother,
keeping an eye on the store while his older brother leads people into the
stables to look at the horses.

The Dining Room~
The large dining room is normally quiet except for when meal time
approaches, than it is a flurry of activity as the servants set the table
and bring in the food that isn't hot.  The High Lords and Ladies all sit on
either side of the table but no one sits on the ends so that everyone is on
equal footing.  Hanging from the ceiling over the table are two chandeliers
made of glass prisms with candles all around the top that reflect the light,
causing rainbows to dance about the room.

A Dead End~
The narrow alley suddenly ends, barely any light seems to come here,
making the shadows that much deeper.  Trash and other refuse has been thrown
about all over but in one corner nothing sits in a small area and upon
closer inspection a small handle can be seen along an almost invisible seam.

The darkness of the alley is suddenly pushed away by a set of lanterns

When the door opens not far above them they all jump up and draw their
daggers, ready for a fight.

The Torture Chamber~
{rL{x{Ri{x{Yg{x{Rh{x{rt{x flickers from the lanterns hung from the ceiling of this damp room
made of {Dstone{x.  Its only occupant is a slender and tiny man by the name of
Olof, though occasionally he does have a 'guest' or two visit him.  The
center piece of the room is a large, five-star {yta{x{rb{x{yle{x with thick {Dleather{x
straps attached to it.  Those that visit the chamber get to have a rest on
this uncomfortable looking piece of equipment but the table is the least of
their worries.  Placed on smaller, normal, {ytables{x are various items, one
holds slender knives, another thicker knives, hammers, chisels and numerous
odd looking metal utensils cover the tables in an array of {Wglittering{x metal.
One other table stands out against the rest, this one is {ywooden{x but it has a
sheet of {Dmetal{x nailed into the top and on it rests numerous pokers of
various shapes and sizes and beside the table is a large metal bowl full of
{rhot{x coals.  Though as {Ddark{x as the floor may be {rblood{x stains can still be
seen all around and under the large table.  Light help those within the
cells just a short walk down the hall for whenever one is brought into this
room the screams of Olof's guest rings loud and clear in all the cells, its
a scream of pain so terrorizing even the heartiest would quake in terror.

beneath, making footing for the inexperienced a little uncertain.  A long
gangplank heads up onto the deck of the ship to the east and back to the
north is the docks and the city of Tear.

Main Deck~
The main deck of the {BS{Cea{Bf{Col{Bk{x raker is busy with various sailors moving
from one spot to another, checking ropes and ensuring everything is in
working order.  The ship is narrow compared to most ships, but very long,
the open deck vary large in size.  Three large {ymasts{x can be seen nearby,
rising high into the air to hold the {Wsails{x of the ship, each rolled up and
tied to help keep the ship safely in place while in dock.  To the north is
the bow of the ship, and to the south is the raised platform of the
sterndeck.

it's used to look for obstacles when out at sea.

below.  A large, spoked {ywh{ree{yl{x is in the center of the deck, a heavy rope
lashed around it, to keep it from turning while in dock.  A tall railing
surrounds the sides and back end of the sterndeck, providing a nice place to
stand and watch the waters splash up against the hull of the ship.  A narrow
hatch is open, leading down to the Sailmistress's quarters just below.

The room is rather large, the ceiling high, for what one might expect to
find on a ship.  Everything in the room is kept neat, and everything seems
to be built into the room itself.  A table surrounded by chairs rest in the
center of the room, each nailed to the floor.  A large bed rests underneath
windows that let in some light and give a view of the waters outside. 
Rolled charts are kept on the table, and ivory carvings are kept on railed
shelves.  Half a dozen bare-bladed swords rest on hooks that hang from the
walls.

Among the Columns~
Round, red columns line the walkway towards the heart.  Each column leads
straight to the ceiling, where they are connected by a set of arches.  The
grey stone floor is covered with a thick layer of dust, having been
undisturbed for some time.  The Lords of Tear obviously do not allow
visitors in this place.  The only light in this huge room is from the glow
of Callandor.

A Narrow Stairwell~
The bare walls, punctuated by the occasional oil lamp shedding its light,
makes it seem like the hallway is even more narrow than it already is. 
Barely two can walk abreast, and it is obvious that this stairway is not
used too often.

A Rare Sandy Beach~
Although the city of Tear is known for its {ym{ru{yddy{x streets, it looks as if
you have stumbled upon a rarity.  A narrow sandy {yb{De{Wa{ych{x stretches west at
your feet.  The {ys{Da{wn{yd{x is a bit course, not smooth and soft like you would
find at most beaches.  Instead, it looks like little pieces of {Ws{Dh{Well{x that
have been broken by the harsh {Cw{Ba{Wv{Be{Cs{x.  Still, it looks inviting to walk on
and offers an excellent view of where the {Csky{x meets the rough {Bs{Ce{Wa{x.

A Rare Sandy Beach~
The {ys{Da{Wn{yd{x below your feet looks like tiny pieces of broken {W{D{Well{x that have
been washed up onto the shore and pulled back out too {Bs{Ce{Wa{x over many years. 
Still, it is inviting and not a bad place to sit and watch the {Bw{Ca{Wv{Ce{Bs{x crash. 
{WSe{Da{Wgulls{x fly overhead, squacking loudly in the cool {Bo{Cc{We{Ca{Bn{x {cb{Creez{ce{x.

At the Base of a Tower~
A large {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x tower grows from the {ys{Da{wn{ydy{x beach.  At its base are several
large {ybo{wu{Dl{wd{yers{x to protect it from the erosion of crashing {Bw{Ca{Wv{Ce{Bs{x.  Still,
over time, the rocks have been pull, making it look a little rickety, but
still safe to enter for a fabulous view.

Inside a Look Out Tower~
Inside the {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x tower, the view is incredible.  {cW{Cindow{cs{x surround the
entire upper floor, allowing those here to look out over the roof tops of
the city or out to {Bs{Ce{Wa{x.  Beyond the rough waves, {Dwh{wa{Dles{x can be seen with
their tails and fins rising above the {Bw{Ca{Wt{Ce{Br{x.

A Wash Room~
This wash room is decorated entirely in {Wwhite{x.  The walls are painted a
warm {Wwhite{x, the tiles on the floor are {wm{Wa{wr{Wb{wl{We{x, swirling with an even {Wwhiter{x
accent.  All of the furnishings are made from rich oak that has been painted
a sterile {Wwhite{x, and upon carefully carved stands sit fluffy, folded {Wwhite{x
towels.

Hidden Hovel~
This small hovel appears to have been out of use for years.  Some old
mattresses lay along the wall of the single room building.  The doorway to
get in was hard enough to find, but at least you know that it's on the east
side of the building to get out of.  

Comfort and luxury are not what this place is about, but at the same time,
the likelyhood of anyone searching the building to find someone hiding is
fairly remote.

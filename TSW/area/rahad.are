eastern outskirts of the Rahad, a dilapidated district famed throughout
other lands for its bad reputation of crime.  This particular street is

{yA Twisting Street{x~
Here lies one of the many streets that winds their way through the Rahad.
Like most of the roads in this area, this one looks very old and shabby with
a lot of the gray stone paving slabs missing.  The street is flanked by
large buildings whose outer walls have been covered in white plaster
although much of the grimy covering is flaking off.

This is one of the many similar streets that generally winds its way
through the Rahad district.  Like the majority of the roads in this area,
this one looks very old and shabby with a lot of the gray stone paving slabs
missing.  The street is overlooked by large buildings whose exterior walls
have been covered in white plaster although much of the grimy covering is
peeling off from the structures.  This particular road ends abruptly at this
point, cut off by a tall wall that is also covered in white plaster.  There
is an archway that has been built into the wall; beyond the arch a large
courtyard can be seen.

{yA Twisting Street{x~
This is a particularly long and narrow street that twists its way
east/west through the Rahad quarter which seems more like a gathering place
for the citizens of the quarter rather than a road.  Like the majority of
the roads within the area, this street looks well worn from use and in need
of some repairs.  The street is overlooked by large buildings whose exterior
walls have been covered in white plaster although much of the grubby
covering is peeling off from the structures revealing the brickwork beneath.
The majority of the buildings in this area appear to be houses although
there are a few shops.

This is a twisting street that runs east/west through the Rahad, flanked
by tall buildings.  The street looks old and worn, made uneven by broken and
missing paving slabs.  The majority of the decrepit structures along this
road appear to be houses; they have colorfully tiled roofs and have their
exterior walls covered in white plaster although much of it has turned gray
with dirt and large areas of plaster have crumbled off, revealing the bricks
and mortar beneath.  There are a couple of shops to be seen along this road;
they are marked clearly by their brightly painted signs that are hung over
their entrances.

Most of the roads within the Rahad look the same, and this one is of no
exception.  It is a long and narrow street that winds its way east/west
through the district.  Like the majority of the roads within the area, this
street looks well worn from use and in need of some repairs; a few of the

At this point within the Rahad, two twisting roads meet and form a
crossroad.  The surface of these roads looks very old and worn with many of
the gray paving slabs missing.  The crossroad is overlooked from all sides
by tall pale structures.  The buildings look very similar to each other,
each one has had its exterior walls covered in white plaster although over
time the plaster has turned to a grubby gray color and is now flaking off in
places.  Each building is topped by a tiled roof, the color of the roofs
range from golden yellow to crimson red and even deep violet.

{yThe Harbor{x~
This is a long road that runs along docks of the Rahad.  Built along one
side of this long thoroughfare are many brick buildings, mainly warehouses
and workshops.  The bulk of the buildings in this section of the town look
disheveled with much of the white plaster used to coat their exteriors
flaking off.  The bay is visible from this point, there are many boats
moored at the stone docks but many more can be seen traveling along its
water.  The faint salty tang in the air is almost totally obscured by a
pungent yet aromatic mixture of smells emanating from one building on the
east side of this road.

This is the southern end of a long thoroughfare that runs along docks of
the Rahad.  Along one side of the long thoroughfare are many brick
buildings, mainly warehouses and workshops.  The majority of the buildings
in this section of the town look disheveled with much of the white plaster
used to coat their exteriors flaking off with age.  A narrow street that is
also flanked by white buildings leads off from this point to the east.  The
bay can be seen from this point, there are many boats moored at the stone
docks but many more can be seen traveling along its water.

{rThe Postmaster's Store{x~
This is a tiny shop that has mainly been built from brick.  Parts of the
building's timber frame protrude from the white plaster that covers the
walls.  Dusty shelves line the walls of the shop, filled writing equipment
such as paper, inks and pens.  At the center of the room is a wooden
counter; behind the counter lies a rickety stairway leading to the upper
floor of the shop, from which strange cooing noises can be heard.  A large
window built in the southern side of the room is barely translucent from the
dust accumulated upon its panes of glass; a doorway next to the window
provides an exit onto a street outside.

or a dumping ground for useless junk.  The shelves and racks that adorn the

from weapons and armor to trinkets and ornaments.  The only visible exit

This paved courtyard is almost totally encircled by buildings apart from
the western border which is marked with a wall that has been covered with
white plaster.  There is an archway that has been built into the wall;
beyond the arch a long, twisting street can be seen.  Two of the buildings
that overlook the courtyard seem particularly interesting.  There appears to
be a small workshop to the south, dozens of wooden barrels and casks have
been stacked outside the building.  A much larger building sits at the
eastern side of the yard from which a strong, heady aroma of hops and malt
emanates from.

courtyard are marked by three white plaster covered buildings.  The smallest
of the buildings lies to the west is a workshop that has numerous chimney
stacks.  Built onto the side of the building is a veranda supported by
painted wooden beams.  The building that lies on the south side of the
courtyard has a similar porch build onto its facade and is used as a stable.
On the east side of the yard is largest of the buildings which is an inn
that is several storeys high.

buildings is on the north side of the yard, it is a long rectangular
structure whose exterior walls have been covered in white plaster.  The
window frames, shutters and doors of the building have been painted crimson
red, the same shade of red as the tiled roof.  This structure joins onto a
second building that sits on the east side of the yard which appears to be a
workshop.

This small workshop is a sturdy looking building that has been
constructed from bricks and timbers.  Along one side of the room are several
cupboards and drawers that have been painted blue.  There are woodworking
tools littering a workbench that has been built above the cupboards.  A
couple of shelves and racks have been fitted to the wall above the workbench
and are being used to store tools.  There are three narrow windows have been
built at the southern end of the workshop, each of these windows has been
protected from intruders with thick iron bars.  The only exit from this

This particular blacksmith's workshop seems to be quite quiet despite the
area being filled with the heat from the blazing forge.  The workshop
appears to be well organized, the almost countless number of tools belonging
to the owner of this establishment have been neatly arranged in racks that
are fixed upon the brick walls.  A small wooden bench has been placed
against one wall, apart from a folded shirt and cloak there does not appear
to be anything else of interest.  There seems to be two exits, a narrow
doorway on the northern side of the room and a much wider doorway on the
eastern side of the room.

This rather decrepit looking craft that has been secured at a stone dock
appears to be a fishing boat that probably belongs to one of the Rahad
fishermen.  What was once a fine robust vessel painted in bright colors is
looks like a few pieces of driftwood nailed together to form the basic
structure of a boat, with very little of the original paint remaining.  The
bedraggled sails of this fishing boat look like they have been patched many
times over the course of their existence and probably could serve better as
nets than as sails.

This warehouse is a massive gray stone structure that is approximately
square in shape with a low sloping roof supported by thick pillars made out
of gray stone.  The floor of the enclosure has been paved with thick slabs
of dull gray stone that are irregular in shape.  Hundreds of wooden barrels
and casks of varying sizes have been stacked carefully within these four
walls; each barrel appears to be branded with symbols that probably used to
denote their owner and contents.  Perhaps the only other thing of interest
within this area is the pair of wide wooden doors at the west side of the
room marking the exit.

This is an archway constructed from reddish-brown bricks.  The tunnel is
approximately thirty paces in length and tall and wide enough to allow a
cart to pass through it with relative ease.  Some of the stones used to pave
the ground have become loose through wear and tear allowing clumps of weeds
to poke through to the surface.  At the western end is a large plaza tiled
with gray stone slabs which is the site of a large and colorful market and
at the eastern end of the archway is a much duller sight of a muddy yard.

mishmash of bricks, stone and wooden timbers that were used to construct the
inn.  Along the hallway are quite a few sturdy appearing doors that mark the
entranceways into other sections of the inn.  Also placed at set intervals
along the walls of the corridor are hooks used for hanging lamps.  At this
end of the corridor is a steep flight of steps leading into the upper parts
of the inn.

{DA Stone Dock{x~
This stone dock provides an excellent of the bay that lies between the
city of Ebou Dar to the west across the cold gray waters and the Rahad that
lies nearby to the east.  There are hundreds of ships and boats to be seen
in the bay, either traveling along the grayish waters or moored at the
jetties.  Overlooking the docks to the east are tall warehouses, their
exterior walls were once covered with white plaster but patches of the brick
beneath the plaster have been revealed.

{yA Large Ship{x~
This is just a small and bulky vessel used mainly to carry cargo; it
lacks the slenderness and the elegance of the vessels that belong to the
Atha'an Miere.  Perhaps in the past this craft was a fine sight to behold
but now it looks mistreated, much of the paintwork has faded or flaked away
and the sails have had so many repairs done to them they look like patchwork
quilts.  Apart from the grayish waters of the harbor there only appears to
be one exit from this ship, a timber gangplank leading the stone dock which
the ship is moored at.

This ship lacks the slenderness and the grace of the ships that belong to

although it is doubtful that this vessel would be able to withstand long

{gThe Roaming Gleeman{x - {yA Large Common Room{x~
The common room of the Roaming Gleeman is a vast space, dimly lit by oil
lamps suspended from the ceiling.  Despite the vast size of this tavern, it
looks like a rough establishment frequented by equally rough-looking
clientele.  The walls have been left bare at this part of the room,
revealing the jumble of bricks, stone and wooden timbers that were used to
construct the inn.  Finally there is are two stone steps that lead upwards
to a painted blue door on the south side of the common room that probably
lead outside of the inn.

{gThe Roaming Gleeman{x - {yA Large Common Room{x~
The Roaming Gleeman's common room is a massive space, dimly illuminated
by oil lamps that have been suspended from the ceiling.  Although this is
one of the larger taverns within the Rahad, it is also one of the roughest. 
The walls have been left bare at this part of the room, revealing the
mixture of bricks, stone and wooden timbers that were used to construct the
tavern.  A thin layer of wood shavings has been strewn across the
floorboards but they fail to hide old blood stains from past brawls.

This is the western end of a long corridor within one of the Rahad's many
inns.  The walls have been left bare at this part of the room, revealing the
hodgepodge of bricks, stone and wooden timbers that were used to construct
the inn.  Along the hallway are several sturdy appearing doors that mark the
entranceways into other sections of the inn.  Also placed at set intervals
along the walls of the corridor are hooks used for hanging lanterns. 
Further down the corridor to the east are similar doors although a steep
flight of steps leading into the upper parts of the inn can be seen at that
end of the corridor.

and an almost equally bare timber floor.  Frayed drapes frame the windows
along the north side of the room that look out onto the Rahad's countless of
winding streets.  A plain woolen rug has been placed at the foot of the
fireplace on the east side of the room.  The only visible exit from this

This study is a plain-looking room that is roughly square in shape and
mainly occupied by tall bookcases filled with tattered tomes.  A little
light filters in through a pair of dusty windows on the south side of the
room although they offer a rather gloomy view into a brickwork tunnel.  The
main source of light comes from the oil lanterns that have been fitted to
the study's plaster walls.  There is very little else of interest about this
room apart from a fireplace built into the east wall and a doorway in the
north wall.

only items of furniture within this room are a small wooden desk and a hat

a stove and a meat spit.  Numerous cupboards, drawers and shelves have been
fitted in the kitchen; once they were painted in bright colors but now the
paintwork has faded with age and flaking away.  There are two exits, a door

This is the western end of a long rectangular room that is used as a
common room.  There is a large window on the northern side of the room
overlooks the dirty twisting streets of the Rahad.  The room is rather
plain, void of any expensive furnishings probably because of the numerous
brawls and duels that are often fought in taverns like this one.  Sawdust
has been strewn across the floor in an attempt to hide the heavy scuff marks
and blood stains that have marred the wooden floorboards.  There appear to
be only two exits out of this room, similar sized doors at the western and
the southern sides.

of the walls of this room provides a rather bleak view of the busy streets
of the Rahad.  There appear to be only a few basic items of furniture within
this guestroom, a bed, a wardrobe, a desk, a chair and a washstand; all of
the items of furniture look old and well worn.

{WThe Silver Bell Inn{x - {yA Guest Room{x~
This is a plain yet comfy guest room.  The walls of this room look bare;
they have been covered with a thin layer of white plaster and lack any
decoration upon them.  The wooden boards that make up the floor have been
also left almost bare; the only attempt to cover the floor is a small woolen
rug that has been placed by the door.  A large rectangular window set in one
of the walls of this room provides a rather bleak view of the busy streets
of the Rahad, beside the window stands a simple wooden desk and chair. 
There appear to be only a few other basic items of furniture within this
guestroom which include a bed, a wardrobe and a washstand; all of the items
of furniture look old and well worn.

{WThe Silver Bell Inn{x - {yA Guest Room{x~
Although there is a lack of luxurious furnishings in this guest room, the
area could be considered as being comfy.  The walls of this room look bare;
they have been covered with a thin layer of white plaster and lack any
decoration upon them.  The wooden boards that make up the floor have been
also left almost bare although the accumulation of dirt within this area has
turned the floor of this room several grimy shades of gray.  A small
rectangular woolen rug placed by the doorway appears to be the only covering
the floor has.  There is a large window in this room that has been framed
with a pair of slightly scruffy curtains and overlooks the busy streets of
the Rahad.  There are only a few basic items of furniture within this room,
a bed, a wardrobe, a desk, a chair and a washstand.  Anything else that
might have been used to furnish the room has long since been taken away.

{WThe Silver Bell Inn{x - {yA Guest Room{x~
Regardless of the lack of expensive furnishings in this room, this guest
room could be considered as being cozy.  The white plaster covered walls and
the wooden floorboards have been left almost bare although the accumulation
of dirt within this area has turned the walls and floor of this room several
grimy shades of gray.  A small woolen rug placed by the doorway appears to
be the only covering the floor has.  There is a large window in this room
that has been framed with a pair of slightly tatty curtains and overlooks
the busy streets of the Rahad.  There are only a few basic items of
furniture within this room, a bed, a wardrobe, a desk, a chair and a
washstand.  Anything else that might have been used to furnish the room has
long since been taken away.

{WThe Silver Bell Inn{x - {yA Bathroom{x~
At a first glance this room looks rather plain and dull; the wooden
floorboards have been left bare as the walls of this room.  Within this room
is a large bathtub but there are no signs of any sources of water present
suggesting that water has to be brought into the room from elsewhere.  A
small wooden stool has been left beside the tub upon which a large, neatly
folded towel has been placed.  A doorway on the northern side of the room
provides the only exit out of here.

from its skin is made of the strongest natural toxin.  It contains enough
poison to kill several adults.  Merely touching this frog can be lethal.

A fairly tall, middle aged man seems very content with what he is doing. 
He seems to know the patrons of this inn very well and talks to them about
everything.  At times, he seems to listen more than he speaks.  And, all the
while, he fills orders for drinks.  From time to time, he will escape into
the kitchen for more mugs or for special orders of warm drinks.  Other than
that, he walks from {ytable{x to table and sometimes, might even make a wager if
a good game is going on.  He's always ready with a smile for anyone he
recognizes coming into the room.

A tall, dark man stands here, blending into his surroundings.
~
A tall, {yolive{x-skinned man of proper size, towering head and shoulders and
more above the ageless woman, the {Dco{glo{yr{g-{Dsh{gi{yf{gti{Dng{x cloak made of fancloth
hanging down his back.  His face seems hacked from stone and his gaze weighs
the threat in every person that passes, examining every crossing corridor
and wall niche for attackers.  Readiness radiates from him.  He is the
epitome of self-discipline.

This is quite possibly the largest man you have ever seen in your life,

massive, {yhairy{x arms over his chest and glances around the room with
{yh{Yaw{yk{x-like eyes.  His four hundred pound body looks more like a gorilla than

Quotes
 
Thom saying "One of the Prophecies says that the Stone of Tear will
never fall until the People of the Dragon come to the stone. Another says
the Stone will never fall till th Sword that Cannot be Touched is
wielded by the Dragon's hand.
(tEoW pg 158-159 ch 13 "Choices")
 
Moiraine saying "Rand has yet to break the nations, or shatter the world.
Even scholars who have studied the Prophecies for their entire lives do
not know how to interpret them all. What does it mean that he shall slay
his people with the sword of peace, and destroy them with the leaf?
What does it mean he shall bind the nine moons to serve him? What
wound of madness and cutting of hope has he healed? What chains has
he broken, and who put into chains?
(tDR pg 57 ch 6 "The Hunt Begins")

As the plow breaks the earth shall he break the lives of men, and all that 
was shall be consumed in the fire of his eyes. The trumpets of war shall
sound at his footsteps, the ravens feed his voice, and he shall wear a 
Crown of Swords.

page10~
There can be not health in us, nor any good thing grow, for the land is
one with the Dragon Reborn, and he one with the land. Soul of fire, heart
of stone, in pride he conquers, forcing the proud to yield. He calls upon
the mountains to kneel, and the seas give way, and the very sky to bow.
Pray the heart of stone remembers tears, and the soul of fire, love.
 
(ooc - aCoS beginning)

page9~
The unstained tower breaks and bends knees to the forgotten sign. The
seas rage, and the stormclouds gather unseen. Beyond horizon,
hidden fires swell, and serpents nestle in the bosom. What was exalted
cast down, what was cast down is raised up. Order burns to clear his
path.
 
(ooc - LoC end)
~
E
page8~
With his coming are the dread fires born again. The hills burn, and the
land turns sere. The tides of men run out, and the hours dwindle. The
wall is pierced, and the viel of parting raised. Storms rumble beyond the
horizon, and the fires of heaven purge the earth. There is no salvation
without destruction, no hope this side of death.
 
(occ - tFoH beginning)

page7~
Into the heart he thrusts his sword, into the heart, to hold their hearts.
Who draws it out shall follow after. What hand can grasp that fearful 
blade?

page6~
Power of the Shadow made flesh, wakened to turmoil, strife, and ruin.
The Reborn One, marked and bleeding, dances the sword in dreams and 
mist, chains the Shadowsworn to his will, from the city, lost and
forsaken, leads the spears to war once more, breaks the spears and makes
them see, truth long hidden in the ancient dream.

His blood on the rocks of Shayol Ghul, washing away the Shadow,

On the slopes of Dragonmount shall he be born, born of a Maiden
wedded to no man.

page3~
Twice and twice shall he be marked, twice to live, and twice to die.
One the heron, to set his path. Twice the heron, to name him true. Once
the Dragon, for remembrance lost. Twice the Dragon, for the Price he
must pay.
 
Twice dawns the day when his blood is shed. Once for mourning, once
for birth. Red on black, the Dragon's blood stains the rock of Shayol
Ghul. In the Pit of Doom shall his blood free men from the Shadow.
 
(ooc - tGH pg. 325-326 ch 26 "Discord")

Five will ride forth, and four return. Above the watchers shall he
proclaim himself, bannered across the sky...
 
(ooc - tGH pg. 275 ch 22 "Watchers")
~

page1~
And so it shall come to pass that what men made shall be shattered, and
the Shadow shall lie across the Pattern of the Age, and the Dark One
shall once more lay his hand upon the world of man. Women shall weep
and men quail as the nations of the earth are rent like rotting cloth.
Neither shall anything stand nor abide...
 
Yet one shall be born to face the shadow, born once more as he was 
born before and shall be born again, time without end. The Dragon shall
be Reborn, and there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth at his 
rebirth. In sackcloth and ashes shall he clothe the people, and he shall
break the world again at his coming, tearing apart all ties that bind. Like
the unfettered dawn shall he blind us, and burn us, yet shall the Dragon 
Reborn confront the Shadow at the Last Battle, and his blood shall give
us Light. Let tears flow, O ye people of the world. Weep for your 
salvation.

Sonnet CXXVII
By William Shakespeare 1564-1616
 
How oft, when thou, my music, music play'st,
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
With they sweet fingers, when thou gently sway'st
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,
Do I envy those jacks, that nimble leap
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,
Whilst my poor lips, which should that harvert reap,
At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!
To be so tickled, that they would change their state
And situation with those dancing chips,
O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
Making dead wood more bless'd than living lips.
   Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,
   Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.

Sonnet XVIII
By William Shakespeare 1564-1616

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temporate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer's lease hath all to short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometimes declines,
By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimmed.
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st.
   So long as man can breathe or eyes can see,
   So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

Sonnet CXVIII
By William Shakespeare 1564-1616
 
Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove:
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark,
That looks on tempests, and is ever shaken!
It is the star to every wandering bark,
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle's compass come;
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, 
But bears it out oven to the edge of doom.
   If this be error, and upon me prov'd,
   I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.

{wFar End of a Dock{x~
Eastward the wind howls, over the rolling {Bo{Cc{We{Ca{Bn{x where the great
{Dw{wh{Wal{we{Ds{x rise and sound, and flying {gf{Gis{gh{x soar on outstretched fins two paces
and more across, eastward now whirling north, east and north, over small
fleets of fishing {ys{wh{yips{x dragging their nets in the shallower seas.  Some of
these fisherman stand gaping, hands idle on the lines, staring at a huge
array of tall {yve{Wss{yels{x and smaller that purposefully ride the wind's hard
breath, shattering swells with bluff bows, slicing swells with narrowbases,
their {Bbanner{x a {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn hawk{x with talons clutching {Yli{Wg{Yhtning{x, a multitude of
streaming banners like portents of storm.

{wAlongside A Dock{x~
Cargoworkers grunt and groan as they lift heavy crates of cargo to the
sailors on board the sturdy {yship{x that is tied to the dock.  Occationally,
large waves crash against the wooden planks, covering the dock with salty
{Bw{Ca{Wt{Ce{Br{x and granules of {Ws{ya{Wnd{x.  The cargoworkers curse more when this happens
because the moisture makes their crates heavier to hoist to the ship.

to fine scented {yo{Yil{ys{x.  From the back end of the ship, you can hear someone
screaming the need to be careful, ordering everyone and everything.  Too bad
you aren't staying around long enough, or you would surely have a job to do
as well.

Starboard Side of a Merchant Ship~
The hustle and bustle is much more prevalent from this vantage point. 
Sailors scamper across the {ywooden{x deck carrying supplies and cargo into the
holds below while the ship's captain bellows orders that scarcely seem to be
heard.  A dull {Dsh{wee{Dn{x appears on the decks of the ship which has seen many
years of battering from travel within the {BSe{Ca o{Wf St{Cor{Bms{x, but it still
appears sturdy enough...

Port Side of a Merchant Ship~
You finally manage to find a spot where {csa{Wilo{crs{x aren't trying to walk
right over top of you as they carry their burdens.  From here, you find it
quite entertaining to watch the deckboy swabbing the deck.  He appears to be
in some sort of dance as he dodges in and out of the swarm of sailors.  Off
the side of the ship, you notice that the {Wropes{x attaching the ship to the
dock are still there, so this gives you a little more time to explore before
this ship will leave for another port of call.

ominous cloud, lending credibility to the name "{BSe{Ca {Wof S{Cto{Brm{xs."  While you
are lost in your contemplation, the ship's captain continues his verbal
barrage, making you lose your wonderment at the power of the {Bs{Ce{Wa{x.

{Ys{Wu{Yn{x in the sky abandoned by {Wc{wl{Wouds{x, whipping the tops of {ggreen

{wAlong the Dock{x~
Sturdy {ywooden{x posts are buried deep in the ground, supporting the
{ywooden{x planks of the dock.  The posts are almost buried by salt {Bw{ga{Wt{ge{Br{x
and covered with {yba{Dr{yn{Di{yc{Dl{yes{x and {gm{Gos{gs{x.  At times when the tide is high, waves
wash over the planks and the {Bw{Ca{Wt{Ce{Br{x leaks out of the knot holes in the
boards.  A pair of small row {yboats{x have been tethered to the dock, waiting
to be taken out to sea.

Patches of {gm{Gos{gs{x have formed on the sides of the posts when the

A long {ywooden{x dock stretches for several hundred feet in either
direction, built upon sturdy posts made from {gt{Gr{ye{ge{x trunks.  The {Bw{Ca{Wt{Ce{Br{x
is a murky {Bblue{x color from {Ws{ya{Wnd{x and debris that is mixed in by the waves. 
Occationally, a colorful {mf{Mi{Ys{yh{x jumps out of the {Bw{ga{Wt{ge{Br{x or a {Wg{Du{Wll{x

time to time, a playful, colorful {Rc{Yl{Wo{Yw{Rn f{Yis{Rh{x hops from the waves and dives
back into the choppy {Bw{Ca{Wte{Cr{Bs{x, adding a little bit of excitement to the

{wQuarterdeck of the Seaspray{x~
A narrow plank leads from the dock to the massive deck of this {bSe{ca{gf{co{blk{x
ship that has chosen {yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x as its port.  The Quarterdeck is made from
interlocked pieces of {ywood{x that creak softly in places have been worn too
much by the {Wsalt {Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{x, but it is still very sturdy under barefeet.  The
mast stands in the middle of the deck, running straight up to the {rf{Rla{rg{x that
is flapping wildly in the wind.  To the port and starboard side, belay pins
hold lines to the spars and sails.  Sailors are running around like mad
trying to get the ship ready to deport.

The long hallway continues to stretch to the east and to the west. 
Sounds from the east are much more active than the quiet solitude that is
ever apparent to the west.  Occationallly, guests pause here to look out of
the tall, arched windows to admire the view of the southern end of the city,
where trading, training and even a bit of thievery is known to take place. 
They can't help but feel the soft, {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn{x carpet squish beneath their feet. 
It is so soft and padded that if it were proper, most would walk barefoot on
it.

More sounds distinguish the guest hall as you pass this door to the north. 
{BW{Ca{Wt{Ce{Br{x dripping and splashing seems to echo off of hollow, or maybe {Wt{Di{Wl{De{x
walls.  You also notice {Wsteam{x seeping from beneath the door.  Like the rest
of the hallway, arched windows, with sophisticated carvings lining their
edges, have been built into the south wall.  This allows all who are guests
in the {Wpalace{x to survey the majesty of the smallest southern nation.

{wA Long Hallway{x~
A long hallway continues to the east and west.  To the north, you see a
large {ywooden{x door.  You hear the sound of {Rdice{x rolling on the other side and
loud laughter.  Occationally, you might also hear glasses clinking in a
toast.  To the south, arched windows, carved with vines around the edges,
provide a beautiful view of the city of {yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x.

{wA Long Hallway{x~
After passing the intersection to the south, you enter the beautifully
decorated {yguest{x corridor.  The soft {yc{Ya{Wrp{Ye{yt{x beneath your feet is an extension
of the outer hall and is just as soft and inviting.  {yG{Yol{yd{x leaf chandeliers
hang from the sky {Cblue{x ceiling, offering light from a dozen glowing {Wcandles{x.
The maids are most likely grateful for the wax guards that have been
expertly crafted onto these lights, because it would be a shame to have wax
dripping on these carpets.  Four small {Wm{wa{Wr{wb{Wl{we{x-topped {ytables{x are evenly
spaced down the hallway.  They hold delicate {Wv{ma{Wses{x full of fresh {Rf{Ylo{Ww{Yer{Rs{x
that give the air a gentle, springtime scent.

This long hallway continues to extend to the north and south, leading to
rooms that are given to honored guests waiting to speak with the {RF{Wirs{Rt{x.  Its
decor is consistent with most halls in the palace.  The walls are lined with
niches that hold ancient {ytr{Yea{Ws{Yur{yes{x: paintings, {Wstatues{x, trophies, vases of
fresh {mf{Bl{Yo{gw{Ye{Br{ms{x.  On the ceiling, a mastercraftsman has painted a fresco of

placed this relaxing area where the view is most exquisite.  It over looks
the {gga{Grde{gns{x behind the {Wpalace{x and the complicated English maze.  Comfortable

brocade to create depth and color variation.  It makes the room look a bit

waves from the {BSe{Ca o{Wf St{Cor{Bms{x smashing against the sides of the ship.  It
looks rather omnious to be sailing in such waters, but the other {yships{x on
the horizon prove that its possible.  Large coils of {Wrope{x are scattered
across the deck, as well as crates of produce that remain to be stored in
the cargo holds.  Not too far away, a deep-voiced man can be heard barking

This is the area of the ship fondly referred to as "the launches."  Lines
are hoisted across the edge of the {yship{x and over the rails, supporting long
boats that are used in times of trouble.  Though these life boats are never
used, one can see why such a large ship would have them because of the
turbulent {Bw{Ca{Wv{Ce{Bs{x smashing into the raker.

V-shape and at the center is the spoked {ywheel{x.  From here, anyone steering
the ship can see where they are going.  It must be quite a rush to feel the
power of navigating such a large ship through such turbulent {Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{cs{x.

Bridge of the Seaspray~
The interlocking {ywooden{x deck leads to the far end of the raker.  It has
been quite a walk from one end of the bridge to the other.  It is no wonder
that the sailors on this ship are so lean and built.  A mechanism that looks
like a large spool with a crank on one end is wound with thick {Dc{wh{Wai{wn{Ds{x. 
The chains lead from the spool, over the edge of the ship and into the
{Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{x.  Only chains that large would be used to support the massive
{Danchor{x that is needed to keep the ship here at the port.

Climbing up a {Wrope{x ladder, you reach the Crow's Nest.  It looks like a
{ybarrel{x that has been cut in half and built around the mast, but it is large
enough for two people to sit down in.  The view from up here is incredible. 
It seems almost funny that this is where initiates are sent to be lookouts
or to be punished.  The loud sound of the {rf{Rla{rg{x flapping madly in the wind
echoes above you.  It almost seems that in a few more gusts, it will be torn
entirely from its post and blown away.

Gangway~
One of the first things you notice about the space beneath the {ydeck{x of
the ship is how confining it is.  The ceiling is low overhead, causing
everyone that comes down here to duck their heads to avoid bumps and
{Db{mru{ri{mse{Ds{x.  The walls are also quite close, making it diffcult for more than
one person to walk down the hall.  If another person needs to pass, both
must turn to the side and squeeze past each other.  Gimbaled {yla{Ynter{yns{x are
recessed in the ceiling, lighting the pathway in the {Ddarkness{x below deck.

Deep in the belly of the raker, sailors patrol the ship for damage from
unseen {Mcoral{x reefs or tall waves.  The room is surprisingly well lit,
with a dozen {ygi{Ym{Wba{Yl{yed{x lanterns hanging from the ceiling.  This
kind of lighting is necessary so that the {ywooden{x walls can be inspected
for leaks or anything else that might interfere with the safety of the ship.
The bilge room is well kept.  There is no sign of rotting {ywood{x or
neglected repairs.

Mistress of Ships' Cabin~
The Mistress of Ships' cabin is the largest private chambers on the ship.
It is lavishly decorated, with everything in the room securely fastened to
the ground or to the walls to prevent movement on the open {bs{ce{ga{x. 
There is a large {ybed{x beneath the port hole and a {ynarrow{x table in the
center of the room.  Padded armchairs surround the table, probably used for
planning.  The table is covered with {gm{ya{Dp{ys{x, papers and scrolls and
is only cleared when the ship is safely docked.  Everything else in the room
is tidy.

about their business, snacking on some of their preparations from time to
time.  Three punished sailors inhabit the kitchen today as well.  They have

thin.  Here, in the more confined areas of the ship, are the sailor's rooms
and probably the sick bay.  The gimbaled {yla{Yn{Wte{Yr{yns{x are recessed
in the ceiling, but even then, you will probably have to duck so you do not

of {bs{ce{ga{x air and {mlavendar{x soap.  The walls and the floor are made
of {ywooden{x paneling, with waterproof varnish protecting them from
overflow.  The paneling highlights a {Wporcelain{x tub that is built into

to have been built into the room except for a few laquered {ychests{x of

The Gangway~
This section of gangway, like the rest of it leading to the east, is lit
with {yg{Yim{Wba{Yle{yd{x lanterns.  These lanterns are built onto a frame
so that no matter what angle the ship is at, the lamp is always level.  This
is especially helpful on {Ds{wt{Wor{wm{Dy{x days.  The gangway comes to an
end here in front of three doors.  Again, it is quite narrow, making it
quite dificult for more than one person to pass.

Crew's Mess~
This room is where all of the Atha'an Miere meet to converse and bond
while they eat their meals.  Many rows of benches and {ytables{x are bolted
to the floor to accommodate all of the ships occupants.  As you might

Sick Bay~
Like the crew's mess, the sick bay has a tendency to get quite stuffy,
especially when there are several sick sailors in the room.  So the
{gs{Gmel{gl{x does not become overpowering, the portholes on the south wall
are kept open during calm weather.  There are three small beds lined along
the walls with {ywooden{x stools next to each of them.  Cabinets have been
built into the bulkhead to hold supplies that can hopefully nurse the
injured back to health.

It is cleaned each day to impress those that have been granted the right to
travel with the Atha'an Miere.  {yWa{Dln{yut{x cabinets have been built into
the bulkhead.  The light coming through the portholes catches the shimmer in
the {ywood{x's stain, making it look quite expensive.  Two comfortable beds

Parker Street~
The repairs on the road here are current, making it much more passable
than the road to the south.  This is probably because, just to the north,
Parker Street meets Palace, the major intersection of the city.  A few
{rbu{Dil{rdings{x and houses line the road, with little landscaping in front.  Maybe
a {gt{yr{Ge{Ge{x or two that has been pruned.  If there are any {mf{Mlo{Yw{Mer{ms{x, they are
seasonal, because they are wild.

Parker Street~
This {Ds{wt{Wre{we{Dt{x is very plain.  The road is passable, but the repairs on it
are poor.  No shops or houses have been built here either.  The reason is
probably its proximity to what locals call "the poor section of town" to the
south.  No one with even a bit of money would like to be associated with
this part of the city.

built of {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x and {rbr{Di{rck{x.  The windows are framed with {ywo{do{yden{x shutters and
the large front doors are solid {ywood{x.  Each landscape has been neatly kept,
with {gbu{Gsh{ges{x trimmed into spirals and {cf{Cl{Yow{Ce{cr{x beds planned in perfect color

trimmed fir {gt{yr{gees{x and arrangements of {Db{wo{Wul{wde{Drs{x to add interest to the

landscape is not ruined.  Small patches of {gt{Gr{ye{Ge{gs{x and {cf{Clo{Yw{Cer{cs{x have been
planted along this walk way, surrounded by medium-size {Dr{wo{Wc{wk{Ds{x to add
dimension and closure to the landscaping mounds.  It is nice to have a path
off of Palace Road that is not paved in stone.

buildings to the east and west.  Their facades are in severe disrepair, with
{rbrick{x falling from the {Dm{wo{Wrt{wa{Dr{x.  Anything green that might be growing around
them is {gw{yee{gds{x, maybe a straggling tree that will die soon from lack of care.

{wA Jewelry Store{x~
At first glance, it is obvious that this shop takes in quite a bit of
{yg{Yol{yd{x.  Wealthy patrons pass in and out of the front door smiling happily
with their arms around their sweethearts as they carry small parcels wrapped
in {Wwhite{x tissue paper and {gg{Gree{gn{x ribbon.  The shop itself is fairly large, 
with a rich looking {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn{x wallpaper decorating the walls. A {Cc{Wry{Cs{Wta{Cl{x
chandelier hangs in the center of the ceiling, its prisms catching the
{Ysu{Wnlig{Yht{x as it shines through the front display windows, reflecting small
{Rr{Ya{Wi{Gn{Cb{Bo{Mw{Ws{x on the wall. Several large glass display cases are scattered around
the room, filled with {Ws{wp{Wa{wr{Wk{wl{Wi{wn{Wg{x gems and precious {ym{Ye{Wt{Ya{yls.

A large chandelier hangs from the center of the ceiling, covered with one

{YSu{Wnlig{Yht{x shines through the front windows of the shop, where a soft
{rve{Rlv{ret{x blanket has been laid out on a shelf in front of the window.  Several
beautiful pieces of {yj{Yew{We{Ylr{yy{x and large {cd{Wia{cm{Won{cd{xs entice the eyes of people
passing by the window.  A woman with {ybrown{x curly hair stands with her nose
pressed against the glass, pointing out her favorite piece to her husband.

Several glass cases are scattered around the room, lined with soft

have been left on their surfaces have been carefully washed away so that the

The strong aroma of {gt{ye{ga{x fills the air, almost smelling of {gg{Gras{gs and
{cm{Wi{cnt{x.  It is a pleasant scent, very soothing.  The shop of the apothacary is
very homey.  Handmade braided {mr{Mu{mg{Ms{x created from colorful {Ms{mt{Mr{mi{Mp{ms{x of
material decorate the floor and home sewn {Wlace{x curtains hang in the windows.
A {ywooden{x table stands in the middle of the room, covered with potted

Parker Street~
Parker Street, named after a current mayor, has just been built as a
crossroads to connect streets within the city of {yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x.  It is apparent
that this street is newly built, because the {Dm{wo{Wrt{wa{Dr{x between the {Dco{wbb{Wlest{won{Des{x
is still a perfect gray and the stones have very little ware from {ywagon{x
wheels.  Building frames have been built to the east and west, but no
specific buildings have taken shape yet.  It's unclear whether they will be
large homes or shops.

superb.  At the north end of the bank, thick metal bars, painted {yg{Yol{yd{x,

therefore, to make it a section of the city for the public to enjoy.  It is

{Rp{Wi{Rc{Wn{Ri{Wc{Rs{x.  Large {yo{ga{yk t{gr{Gee{ys{x border parts of the grassy field, creating shade

You might also notice that the room is unusually cool, something to do with

fresh.  Looking around at the variety from which to choose and the beauty of

scenes of fishing boats and rakers.  To the east and west, two large

waves and circles.  Each piece is for sale, however, once one is sold, the
display must be reworked.  Thus, showing what a proud owner this man must

why all of the nobles come here.  The accomodations are also lovely.

This shop is small, and with good reason.  It is much easier to clean up
the mess after the morning slaughter.  There isn't much to this room.  A
large {ytable{x, stained with deep {rred{x, stands near the center.  And, along the
wall, there is a crate that is filled with {ci{Cc{ce{x, enough to store meat for a
day.  Next to the crate, there is another small table covered with jars of
{ys{rpi{yce{x and above that table hangs several {Dcl{we{Wav{we{Drs{x, varying in size.  The
butcher is always very neat and careful to keep his store as clean as
possible to prevent rotting and infection.  It's also more appealing for a
customer to shop in a clean environment.

there is a large pile of {ywood{x so that the kiln can stay lit.  Although the

their animals.  The stable is rather large, with ten stales filled with {yhay{x.
On the wall of each stall, there are pegs for harnesses and saddles.  The
wood is still {ybrown{x, instead of gray with age.  One might assume that these
stables were put in fairly recently.

{yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{Ye{x.  It isn't large, but there are plenty of {ggr{Gas{gsy{x areas to play and
benches for relaxing in the shade.  A small play area has even been built
for the children to enjoy, with swings and contraptions to climb on. 
Several large {ywa{Dl{ynut{x {gt{Gr{ye{Ge{gs{x have been left in this area so that picnics can
be enjoyed beneath their protective branches.

An Underground Tunnel~
How odd.  Someone has built an underground tunnel here.  It keeps going
down, down, down.  It is very {Ddark{x and the walls don't look to sturdy.  It
is a puzzle why anyone would do this...  But it is worth exploring.

An Underground Tunnel~
The walls of this tunnel look like they might fall in at any moment,
making traveling through this abyss very dangerous.  From time to time, a
{yroot{x system from a large {gt{Gr{ye{Ge{x has been worked around as the tunnel leads
deeper into the ground.  The smell is very moist and earthen.  {yEa{Drt{yhw{Dor{yms{x
even crawl around here, burrowing back into the floor of the tunnel at the
wettest spots.

The End of the Tunnel~
The dark tunnel ends here, opening into a small room, large enough for
two people to squat in.  There is nothing here, just {Ds{yoi{Dl{x walls, ceiling and
floor.  How odd that someone would take the effort to dig all this way and
end it with no apparent purpose.

A Beautiful Home~
Entering this home through two beautifully carved front {yd{ro{yors{x, one would
see an open entry with {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x tile floors.  Rooms would branch off of it in
different directions, going to the dining room, the den, the living room,
the kitchen.  A wide stair case, covered in a long, {gg{Gree{gn{x rug leads up to
the living quarters.  Carefully carved {yha{rn{yd r{ya{yils{x lead down the side, with
{Dwr{wou{Wght {wir{Don{x rails supporting them.  The owner of this home is probably a
merchant or politician, and definately well to do.

A House~
This beautiful home is older, but its age makes it even more majestic. 
There are four large {Wp{wi{Wl{wl{Wa{wr{Ws{x that support the ceiling at the entry.  And,
between the two north most pillars, there is a stairway that is quite wide
at the bottom and narrows going to the top.  The stairs are covered in rich,
{Rred c{ra{Rr{rp{Re{rt{x that comes down and spills into the entry for a few feet until a
{Wm{wa{Wr{wb{Wl{we{x floor takes over.  Very tall, {ywa{Yl{ynut{x doors lead in all directions,
one to the den, another to the dining room, another to the kitchen.  Guests
are invited to leve their coats with a maid as they enter.

A Pet Shop~
This shop is filled with the sound of meows, chirps and barks that can
even be heard from the street.  It is quite easy to guess what is sold here.
Many of the {ya{Dn{wi{Ym{Da{wl{Ds{x roam freely around the shop or are held within short
{Wfences{x near the center of the room.  Clearly, the shop keeper doesn't
believe in cages.  Many children are here, pointing and talking loudly to
their parents.  Some of them are truly shopping for a pet, others are
begging as their parents roll their eyes, hoping to escape with a new
friend.

A Sweet Shoppe~
The overwhelming scent of sugar fills the air of this sweet shop.  On the
shelves on the walls, jars and bottles hold treats, both homemade and
imported.  Many of them can be purchased with a few copper coins.  On the
counter tops, covered with glass boxes, are {yc{Yar{yamel {Rap{Gpl{Res{x, striped {Mcandy{x
sticks, {yfudges{x, {Yt{Ca{Yf{Cf{Yi{Ce{Ys{x and {Dch{yoc{Dolate{x dipped {Rst{rra{Rwbe{rrr{Ries{x.  Large copper
vats sit atop two large cooking ovens.  One of them is filled with boiling
ingredients, mostly sugars.  Soon, one of the sweetest {yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x treats will be
served.

A House~
This carefully maintained house is one of four at the end of the dirt
road.  Its owner obviously takes great pride in its appearance.  It is
nothing fancy, but the interior is well-furnished and cared for, with a
beautiful {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x fireplace and tall, open windows.  Soft {yr{Yug{ys{x cover the floor
and even a few paintings have lavishly been hung on the walls.

The Kitchen~
A fairly fancy kitchen fills this back room of the inn.  It's average in
size and painted a sterile {Wwhite{x.  The floor is covered in {Dblack{x and {Wwhite{x
checker tiles, which can be a bit risky when they are wet from dish washing.
Two large {Dm{we{Wt{wa{Dl{x ovens are built into one wall.  Smoke escapes one of the
oven doors, because it is cracked just a hair, allowing the aroma of
something yummy baking to fill the room.  Perhaps the cook does this to
entice the inn patrons to purchase food.  Cabinets also line the walls, full
of dishes and mugs.  Under one set of cabinets, a hole has been cut into a
table top, and a {cbu{Cbb{cli{Cng{x bucket has been placed in it, filled with dirty
dishes.

A Hallway~
After climbing the {gca{Grpet{ged{x stairway, you enter a hall that leads to more
of the inn's rooms.  Each room has a theme and houses objects from the
country that they are named after.  The same soft carpet that covers the
stairs stretches down the hall, making it seem longer than it really it, but
adding to the quaintness of the inn.  The walls are painted a warm {Wwhite{x,
with stenciled {gvi{Gn{ges{x climbing from the floor to the ceiling.  Even the
candle lit lamps that hang from the wall have a country theme.  The glass
tumblers are supported by {yb{Yras{ys{x shaped bundles of wheat.

Just outside of these doors, a vase of {bf{Bl{Mo{Yw{Ber{bs{x has been left.  They are
meant for the inn patrons to take inside and enjoy.

{wThe {RA{Wn{Rd{Wo{Rr{Wa{Rn{x {wRoom{x~
This room is painted with wide stripes of {Rred{x and {Wwhite{x that are broken
up by four large windows on the north wall and frequent paintings hanging on
the east and west walls.  The paintings are of Andoran symbols: the Lion
Throne and the Rose Crown.  Each of them is framed in a formal, {yg{Yol{yd{x painted
frame to match the decor of the room.  The furniture pieces are all very
unique and carved beautifully by Ogier.  The pads that protect the chairs
are made of {rre{Rd si{rlk{x and embroidered with {Wwhite{x lions.  Decorative tables
and stands are placed tastefully around the room, holding beautiful statues
leafed in {yg{Yol{yd{x or {Ws{wi{Dlv{we{Wr{x mined in Andor.

As you enter this room, you see its theme spread across the opposite
wall, painted in an elaborate, beautiful many-rayed {Ys{yu{Yn{x rising on a field of
{bb{Blu{be{x.  The entire room is decorated in {bb{Blue{bs{x and {yg{Yold{ys{x to depict the Sun
Throne of Cairhien.  All of the furniture is made of fine, rich woods.  The
lines are simple and straight, with sharp edges that are very proper.  Even
the windows in this room are perfect squares.  The ceiling has been raised,
so that wooden beams look to support it.  They have been laid out in a very
straight grid pattern, and instead of being carved, the beams are square
angles and stained a rich {ywa{rln{yut{x color.

with lovely {Wdraperies{x covering the windows.  When opened, they look as
though they would flow gently in the breeze.  The floors are covered in
woven tapestries of horizontal {bb{Blu{be{x and {yg{Yol{yd{x.  A thistle and a star have
been woven into the center of the main tapestry in the room that has been
placed in front of a {Wwhite m{wa{Wr{wb{Wl{we{x fireplace opposite the bed.  The fluffy,
{Wwhite{x comforter on the bed is the only thing in the room that may represent
a well-known people in Amadicia: the Children of the Light.

moderately priced room, it is very nice.  The furniture is made from
handcarved {ywalnut{x wood and covered in unusual {Df{yu{wr{Ds{x.  Colorful {mf{Man{ms{x
decorate the walls.  Anyone that knows anything about Saldaea would suspect
these fans are used to dance the Sa'sara.  A large fireplace on the south
wall supports a mantle that is weighted down with trolloc {Whorns{x and other
borderland momentos.  A large banner hangs down the back of the entry door,
embroidered with three {Ws{wi{Dlv{we{Wr{x fish on a field of dark {bblue{x.

Stairways going up and down from here pause to allow patrons onto the
inn's second floor.  The stairways are covered in a rich, {gg{Gree{gn{x carpet that
continues down the hall.  The glass and {yb{Yras{ys{x lamp fixtures on the wall are
very pretty and add to the country motif of the hallway, as do the painted
{gvi{Gn{ges{x on the walls.  Going up looks as if it might lead you to the roof. 
And going down, one will find the inn's sitting room.

the homeless outside.  Inside, the {Dd{wus{Dty {ywooden{x floors have footprints, and
the {Dd{wu{ys{Dt b{yun{Dn{wi{Des{x have drifted into corners.  There are two moth eaten
{Dbe{wdr{Dolls{x in the center of the room, with a make-shift fire pit and the
reminants of a meal or two - mostly {Wb{Do{Wnes{x.  The only other thing in this
room is a large {Dc{wob{Dwe{Db{x stretching from one ceiling beam to another.  Fly
abdomens and wings have been left hanging in the threads, leaving gapping
holes in the web.

Tall, {ybrown g{gra{yss{x and unwanted {mth{gis{mtl{ges{x grow up around most of the {Ds{wt{Won{we{Ds{x

upon them.  A few {ywooden {Wcrosses{x peek above the grass, but their names have
long since faded in the hot sun and humidity.  In the center of this
memorial stands a large crypt, covered in {Dsoot{x and pock-marked with age.

Toy Store~
This shop is almost hidden on a side street off of Parker.  So, only
those knowing about it or hearing about it from word of mouth can find it. 
It is a smaller shop, but so fun to see.  It is painted a variety of {Rc{Yo{Gl{Bo{Mr{Ws{x,
looking almost like a Tinker encampment, but that's part of the reason it is
so fun.  Another reason is the {yshelves{x and shelves of handmade toys, each of
them unique and carefully crafted so that they are a joy for anyone to own.

House~
This small house is humble, especially considering its location, but it
is still well-kept.  The owner obviously takes pride in it, because the
walls have been freshly {Wpainted{x and the floor has been swept.  The walls are
barren, with no curtains hanging around the windows and no paintings on the
walls, but it helps the house to feel clean, instead of empty.  Another
thing that makes it feels homey is the {Dca{wld{Dron{x hanging in the fireplace.  It
boils fiercely, filling the air with the smell of {yb{re{yef s{rt{yew{x for dinner.

A horrid screeching noise from unused hinges is heard as the rotting front
{ydoor{x is pushed open into an old, abandoned room.  The putrid smell of
something decaying escapes out the open door, creating a breeze that stirs
sheets of {Ddusty{x {Wco{Db{Wwebs{x hanging from the rafters.  An old, {Ddust{x covered
clerks counter has been pushed into the wall, a large hole rotted in its

A Gambling House~
This small {ys{Dh{yanty{x seems very popular to the inhabitants of this section
of town, which is odd because none of them appear to have money to spare. 
The floors are made of old, creaking {yw{Yo{yod{x, but they are well-oiled to
present a smooth surface for the dicers to gamble upon.  A few stools are
situated near the bar so patrons can enjoy a swig or two in between games,
but most prefer to sit on the floor.  Upon closer inspection, the doors
appear very well maintained and have stout {yo{ga{yk beams{x with which to block
them...  Whether to keep people out or prevent them from leaving is still a
question that begs an answer.

the floors have been swept clean from all the {yd{ri{yrt{x that muddy boots bring

A Bedroom~
This room is reserved for Traesa's favorite lady.  She gets to entertain
her clientele within the walls of the largest room in the bordello.  Like
the rest of the house, everything in the room is worn or faded.  But this
room has more furniture and luxuries.  Tall windows line the west wall. 
They are hidden by {Wl{Dac{Wy{x curtains that were once {Wwhite{x but are now {Dgray{x
in color.  The floors are covered with soiled {Dr{Bu{Yg{Ds{x that used to be quite
colorful and elegant.  Still, they are better than the cold {ywooden{x floor. 
Perhaps the most distinguishing amenity in this room is its {rf{Rir{Ye{Wp{Yl{Rac{re{x. 
No other room has this luxury, except the parlor.

Room number two is {Ddarker{x than the others.  Perhaps because the
inhabitant likes to keep her clientele on their toes.  One solitary {Yca{Wnd{Yle{x
rests on a make-shift bedstand.  The bedstand, like most of the pieces in
this room have been constructed from old {yfurniture{x parts that were left from
the days when the house was new.  It is no less inviting, however, and
clients don't really care how the room looks anyway.  They do not give
Traesa their money to admire the walls.

A Deserted Building~
The inside of this building is as decrepit as the outside.  It looks as
if it might have been a shop at one time, but the {yshelves{x either half hang
from the walls now, or lie broken on the floor.  Any furniture that might
have been used has been looted, leaving only {Dd{wu{Dst{x on the floor.  The windows
have also been painted {Dblack{x so that no one can see inside.

House~
This house, very near the "bad section" of town, is currently
uninhabited.  It is no wonder, because of its disrepair.  Two sparse
{yca{Db{yinets{x hang on the wall, both of them with broken hinges.  The fireplace
is a crumbling mass of {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x, making it near impossible to cook anything in,
let alone to hang a {Dcaldron{x.  {DCo{wb{Ww{we{Dbs{x hang in the corners and no one has
bothered to sweep the {yd{ri{yrt{x and {Dd{wu{Dst{x from the floor.

A House~
The sparse furnishings in this home indicate that it is inhabited and
therefore you are trespassing.  The {Dd{yir{Dt{x floor is packed hard and shows
signs of having been swept once in a great while.  The few pieces of
{yfurniture{x itself appear worn-out and mismatched.  And the windows are all
boarded up so that no one can see inside.  Nothing of value exists in this
place, it has either all been stolen or the owner is smart enough to keep
things simple living in this part of town.

{wThe Sailor's Pit{x~
Boisterous laughter and drunken shouts fill the Common Room of the
Sailor's Pit, a melting pot for thieves, sailors and low-lives.  The air
reeks of {Dsmoke{x, liquor and sweat, only two small windows have been built
into the room and they are both closed, holding the smell inside.  The walls
are {yst{Ya{yi{Yn{yed{x and dirty and paint peels from their surfaces from years of
neglect.  The floor is made of rotting {ywood{x and looks as though it hasn't
been swept in ages from the {rm{yu{rd{x and {Ddust{x that covers it.  Overall, the room
is dark, dirty and uninviting.  A rickety staircase leads to some rooms
upstairs.

The Sailor's Pit common room might be the best room in the entire inn. 
It was redone a long, long time ago, but still more recently than any of the
other rooms.  The floors are {ywooden{x.  They might be swept once a month, so
all kinds of debris covers the ground.  The tables and barstools and {Dd{yir{Dty{x
and sticky, but the patrons here don't seem to care.  The {Dfi{wre{Wp{wla{Dce{x in the
corner looks like it hasn't been used in years...  And {Dash{x still sits in it
from that last time it was used.  Perhaps it is a symbol of everything else
about this place - everyone is just too lazy to clean it up.

about keeping it up.  A rickety staircase leads down and rooms are vacant to

There is very little to this run-down room.  Only two pieces of furniture
adorn the dirty floors, and the window appears to have been {yboarded{x over
many years ago.  Other than the cot, a sole vanity sits against a wall.  Its
{cm{Cirro{cr{x is broken and tarnished, and for some odd reason, all the drawers are
missing.  So, it is not even worth using.  Unless, for some odd reason, you
want to sit something on its {Dd{yu{Ds{yt{Dy{x surface.

An old, nasty stench of {Gr{ga{ync{gi{Gd{x {Yc{wh{ge{we{Yse{x fills this sorry excuse for a room.
There is no furniture to speak of, except for the {yc{Wo{yt{x thrown against the
wall.  The windowless walls are of {rst{Dai{rned{x {Wm{wo{yl{wd{Wy {Ww{wo{yo{wd{x, and spotted with dark
{rst{Ra{rins{x.  The scarred room requires effort to tread through, as the sticky

is doubtful.  The walls are very {Ddark{x and even {Ds{woo{Dty{x from candles that used
to hang on the walls to provide light during the inn's glory days.  Now, the
guests are left to fend for themselves.

The roof of the inn is less than tidy, or even habitable.  It is covered
in pigeon {Wdro{yp{Dpi{Wngs{x and {ydi{Dr{yt{x.  It looks like it has been used for a storage
area because of all the empty crates that litter the ground or perhaps it is
a place to take garbage when the owner did not know what else to do with it.
There is one good thing about it.  The view of the city is quite incredible
from here, especially the view of the {BSe{Ca o{Wf St{Cor{Bms{x...  If you can find a

a place were one can come to enjoy a rather pleasant view of the city of

homemade knickknacks from around the city.  A {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x fireplace houses an

old, broken {Dco{wbb{Wles{wto{Dne{x walkway.  The stones that still exist are moderate
in size and rise just enough to catch your foot and trip you.  The walls are
also a bit different than the rest of the tunnel to the north.  In places,
there are still some {rbricks{x that have not crumbled.  Looking closely, you

Large {Dfl{wie{Ds{x buzz all over the room.  Until you entered, they were stagnant,

A {Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{x main has broken somewhere in the city and is leaking into the
underground.  Here, it is very wet.  In fact, just crossing this section of
the tunnel, you will probably get soaked up to your knees or higher.  The
only thing that is keeping this mess from flowing out into the rest of the
underground is a set of four steps on either side.  They have been built,
for whatever reason, and contain the water for now.  It also looks as if
someone has fixed a {Wr{yo{Wpe{x to a sturdy {ybr{ga{Gn{ych{x that hangs from the ceiling.  If
you can get the rope, you might be able to swing across without getting wet.

The underground tunnels collide at an intersection that seems rather dry
compared to other sections beneath the city.  Reminants of past inhabitants
have been left here, however the evidence isn't necessarily good, leading
you to think that {Dshady{x business has taken place here.  The floor is stained
a {rdarker{x {Rcolor{x in some places and the walls have long, deep gashes in them,
probably from {Dd{wa{Wgg{we{Dr{x blades.  This isn't the safest place to be, especially

maybe there is.  Other than the dead {yrat{x on the ground, the room is barren.

{DAn Underground Tunnel{x~
The {Dco{wbb{Wlest{won{Des{x walkway has all but disappeared now.  In its place,
there is nothing but a {rm{yud{rdy{x, potholed floor, making it very difficult and
dangerous to traverse.  The {rbrick{x walls have also deteriorated as well. 
Instead of being mostly together, they are now mostly falling apart.  Pieces
of brick lay on the ground, mingled with a few, sickly looking {gwe{Ge{gds{x that
have managed to sprout here.  If you look closely at the walls where bricks
have fallen out, you could swear that there are holes leading to another
rooms or sections of the tunnel.

{DAn Underground Tunnel{x~
This section of the tunnel looks like it was built for a specific
purpose.  Its walls are lined with {rbricks{x that are still in good repair,
most of them at least.  In some places, the {Wm{wo{Drt{wa{Wr{x has cracked and allowed a
brick or two to slip, but no one above ground really cares because they
never see it.  For the next few feet, the floor is also paved with
{Dco{wbb{Wlest{won{Des{x.  They are moist and a bit slippery from the humidity in the
air, but it doesn't make them unuseable.  In the distance, the sound of
{Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{x dripping can be heard.

Beneath the city streets of {yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x, the air is cold and damp.  It smells
of {rd{yi{rrt{x and {gm{Gilde{gw{x, perhaps from the {Bw{ca{Wt{ce{Br{x dripping in the distance.  A
rickety {ywooden{x ladder is braced against the {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x wall.  Light seeps through

{DAn Underground Tunnel{x~
From somewhere up above, {gt{yr{ge{Ge{x roots have grow down into the tunnel.  Some
of them are quite thick and covered in an almost {gs{Glim{gy{x {ybark{x because of the
moisture in this room.  These roots make it rather difficult to continue
south into the tunnel because they form a maze.  Each {ybr{ga{Gn{ych{x must be climbed
over or crawled under, or if you have the time, cut away.  It is impossible
to stay clean as you make your way through this section of the {Dunderground{x.

After making your way through the maze of {Gt{yr{ge{Ge{x {ybranches{x, you realize that
maybe this is a place that wasn't meant to be found.  Unlike much of the

down here either...  Well, only a few deserted {Dc{wob{Ww{web{Ds{x that hold {Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{x

the underground was built, so that thieves and other shady people would have

The roar of the {Bw{Ca{Wt{Ce{Br{Wfall{x can be heard in the distance, echoing off the
walls of this underground {Dcave{x.  Like the room above, it's very moist and
{Ddark{x.  The stalagtites in the cave are more complete, growing long enough to
meet the stalagmites that grow up from the floor, some of them joining to
form columns that thicken over time as the water continues to seep down
them.  The room is uncharacteristically warm.  A bit of {Wsteam{x even escapes
the cracks in the {Dl{ra{Dva rock{x floor, giving the room a faint {gsu{Gl{Wphu{Gr{gic{x
scent.

This almost obscure section of the {Dcave{x is very {Ddark{x and hidden in the
shadows.  It's a small room, barely large enough for four people to enter
with their heads ducked so they don't hit the ceiling.  It's very warm and
{Wsteamy{x.  Several pieces of {Dl{ra{Dva rock{x and bits of torn {yrag{x litter the floor.

{wClimbing Up the {yVo{Rl{yc{Wa{yno{x~
The air becomes noticably warmer as the trial creeps up the steep slope

{Dl{ra{Dva rock{x for several hundred feet and then, suddenly, the lining stops as

edge of the crater is very jagged, surrounded by sharp {Dl{ra{Dva rocks{x thrusting

Upon entering this farm house, you notice that it is not as small as it
seems to be from the outside.  New additions have been added to the
posterior end, creating more room in the sitting parlor and the kitchen, as
well as a hallway that looks as if it stretches back to some bedrooms.  The
house smells of baking {yb{Wre{yad{x and {yro{Das{yt beef{x and the table is set, waiting
for the farmer to return from his chores for dinner.  The lady of the house
keeps it clean and tidy.  The floor is swept and polished and not a speck of

unusually dramatic signature along the bottom, making it stand out among the
other works of art.  There are also two large marble statues on either side
of the south door, one holding a bundle of wheat, symbolizing prosperity. 
The other holding a hawk on his arm, symbolizing the country of Mayene.  A

No matter which direction you travel in, you will most likely hit a deadend
before you find your way out.  All of the {gbu{Gsh{ges{x have been cut the same,
they are flat and tall, so there aren't any marks to use for disinction. 
Perhaps the only way to know if you have traveled here before is to note the
few {Rfl{Yowe{Rrs{x that bloom from the ground.  Or, hope that one of the {ya{Dn{wima{Dl{ys{x in
the area holds still long enough for you to find a way out.

Royal Road~
The path around the {Wpalace{x detours onto a small, private road.  The
grounds are very well maintained, with tall, manicured {gt{Gr{ye{Ge{gs{x and a variety
of different colored {rr{Ros{re{x {gbu{Gsh{ges{x.  The road itself is made of {Dco{wbb{Wles{wto{Dne{x,
like the palace road, making it easier for horses and carriages to traverse
this section of this city.  Everyone that passes this way is dressed in the
fine silk of a noble or the fine livery of a servant.

A {cP{Con{cd{x~
In the center of the {gm{Gaz{ge{x, a decorative {cp{Con{cd{x has been built.  It is
surrounded by beautifully cut {Dg{wr{Wa{Dn{wi{Wt{De{x boulders that have been stacked to
form small pools and waterfalls for the regal {Ws{Dw{Wans{x to bask in.  Rose
bushes, blooming with bright {Rr{re{Rd{x blossoms, have been planted in a staggered
formation between pristine {Wwhite{x benches.  This section of the maze has been
carefully planned and very well kept.  It is the perfect location for a
peaceful afternoon, or maybe even a wedding.  It's a shame it is difficult
to find.

The Royal {gG{Ga{Yr{gd{Ge{Yn{x~
The royal {gg{Ga{Yr{gd{Ge{Yn{x is by far the most beautiful park in the city.  Tall,
graceful {Wstatues{x decorate the grounds, surrounded by carefully planned
circles of {mt{Mulip{ms{x and {ybu{Ytt{yer{Ycu{yps{x.  There are also several elegantly carved
fountains spitting crystal {Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{x into the air, filling the garden with a
cool, refreshing mist.  The {gbu{Gsh{ges{x have been trimmed to resemble animals,
spirals or cones.  Everything in the garden has been cultivated to
perfection in honor of the First of {yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x.

Royal Road~
Large manors begin to line the {Dco{wbb{Wles{wto{Dne{x road, made of {rbrick{x and stone
and all types of rich materials.  The {gga{Grde{gns{x in front of them are very well
kept and landscaped with all kinds of plants and colorful {mfl{Mo{Yw{Me{mrs{x.  It
almost seems a shame that their inhabitants spent little time in them.  Most
of the {yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x nobility spend their days in court, vying for the favor of the
{RF{Wirs{Rt{x.

A large, beautifully landscaped {gga{Grd{gen{x decorates the entry to this noble
manor.  The {gt{Gr{ye{Ge{gs{x have been shaped into spirals or graceful bulbs, blooming
with small, {Yyellow{x flowers.  {GI{gv{Gy{x grows around the doorway and windows of the
manor's {rs{Dt{wo{Dn{re{x exterior, giving it a classical, almost antique appeal.  In a
few months, it will be climbing the chimney as well.  The nobles that own
this home must hire a private gardener to keep their grounds looking so
immaculate.

entirely of {Wwhite m{wa{Wr{wb{Wl{we{x tiles, spaced with a deep {Dblack{x mortar, giving it
an almost checkered appearance.  The tiles continue onto two staircases that
curve around either side of the room, leading to the upper landing and the
bedrooms.  Tall {Wm{wa{Wr{wb{Wl{we {Wpillars{x support the two-story ceiling, with a massive
{Wcr{wy{cs{wt{Wal{x chandelier in the center.  Double doors made of a rich walnut lead
to rooms to the east, west and north.

An Elegant Hallway~
The hallway that leads through the upper level of the manor is wide and
spacious, especially here at the top of the stairs.  A {yw{Ya{ylnut{x railing has
been built around the edge for safety and allows for a spectacular view of
the double staircase that leads up to this balcony.  At the top of the
stairs, there is a large nook that holds a {Rm{Wo{Dsi{Wa{Rc{x crest of the noble family.
It is very detailed and complex, taking a master craftsman many months to
complete.  To the east of the hallway, the bedrooms begin, hidden behind
large {yma{rho{ygany{x doors.

The Formal Living Room~
After entering the large {yw{Yo{yoden{x doors, you notice that this room is
painted in dark {gg{Gr{geen{x hues, making it warm and inviting.  Thick {rcherry {ywood{x
mouldings line the walls at the floor and ceiling, ornately carved with
swirls and small fish, this family's crest.  The floors are covered with a
rich, hand woven {gca{yrp{get{x that is dark {ggreen{x around the walls and {ybeige{x in the
center.  A {rf{Rir{Ye{Wp{Yl{Rac{re{x as tall as the tallest Mayener is built into the east
wall.  Its mantle is built from {rcherry {ywood{x as well and carved with the same
designs as the moulding.  This room is perfect for a family evening at home,
relaxing by the fire and reading.

The Formal Dining Room~
In the late afternoon, the dining room {ytable{x is set with {ccr{Wyst{cal{x and
{Wchina{x for the evening meal.  Whether there are guests or not, dinner is
always a formal affair and only the best is served.  The dining room caters
to this time of day, being decorated very formally itself.  The walls are
hung with hundred year old {mt{Map{De{wst{Dr{Mie{ms{x depicting nobles at court and popular
{yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x landscapes.  Hunting trophies also hang from the walls, most of them
{ydeer{x or moose heads, but there are also some large, preserved sword {gfi{Gsh{ges{x. 
Large, {Dwr{wou{Wght {wir{Don{x chandeliers hang from the ceiling with a dozen glowing
candles in each of them.  Their dancing {rf{Rl{Ya{Wm{Re{rs{x reflect in the polish on the
{yhardwood{x floor below.

The Kitchen~
The kitchen is quite large and spacious, literally a cook's dream come
true.  There is plenty of counter space, with {Ds{wi{Wn{wk{Ds{x built into the surface
for washing dishes and foods.  {CW{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{x runs out of the house through pipes
that are built in the base of the sink and lead out of the wall.  Buckets
must still be used to fill them, however.  In one corner, there is an {Di{wr{Wo{Dn{x
box used to hold {Ci{cc{Ce{x to keep {rm{yea{rts{x and other produce fresh until they can be
cooked later in the day.  Even at the busiest times, the kitchen is kept
clean and orderly.  The aromatic scent to {yb{Wa{Mk{We{yd{x goods drifts from the
kitchen and fills the manor, especially in the late afternoon.

A Luxurious Study~
The manor's study is large and ornate, decorated with rows and rows of
expensive {ywooden{x shelves covered with books and ancient {Dm{ga{wp{Ds{x.  The
furnishings are lavish and well kept, each in its place.  There are three
waist high {Wp{wi{Wl{wl{Wa{wr{Ws{x in the room, each holding a {Wm{wa{Wr{wb{Wl{we{x carved bust.  The
first is of a young man with a long, curling mustache.  The other two seem
to be the same person at different stages in his life.  There are also two
{cg{Wlas{cs{x cases holding small {Wstatuettes{x and {ypo{rt{Dt{re{yry{x.  It is clear that the
noble who owns this home is quite wealthy because he has collected so many
rare and unusual things.

The hallway continues to the south, leading to more of the manor's
bedrooms.  A {rr{Re{rd{x carpet stretches down the center of the hallway, hiding the
{yhardwood{x floor, except for a few inches near the wall.  It gives the hallway
a rich glow and a touch of class.  Again, nooks have been built into the
walls to hold {Dan{wt{Wiq{wu{Des{x purchased from all over the world.  The {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn{x lights
that hang from the ceiling have been hung just right to illuminate these
treasures.

A Private Guest Room~
The manor's guest room is decorated in deep {rr{Red{rs{x and soft {Wwhites{x to favor
this mistress of this house.  She has chosen to paint the walls with a
sterile {Wwhite{x and decorate them with portraits painted in {rre{Rd{rd{Ri{rsh{x hues. 
Between the paintings, nooks have been built to hold {ccr{Wyst{cal{x vases full of
blooming {rr{Re{rd{x roses that are replaced weekly.  They fill the room with an
soft, flowery scent.  Two large doors, trimmed with {Wwhite{x moulding are
partially open to a small balcony overlooking the manor's {gga{Grd{gen{x.  A gentle
breeze creeps inside and ruffles the {Wfur{x rugs that cover the floor.

The nursery is decorated in bright {Wwhites{x and soft {Mp{Ca{Ys{Gt{We{Ml{Cs{x to cater to
the creative mind of a child.  Everything in the room is large and soft,
perfect for a child to play with.  The eastern wall is lined with tall,
narrow windows, paned with thick {Wwhite{x moulding.  They let the morning sun
shine in brightly unless the {Wcurtains{x are pulled over them to allow a child
to sleep.  There are several shelves, painted {Wwhite{x, that are stacked with
blocks and stuffed animals and two toy {ychests{x filled with everything that
might spark a child's imagination.  The floor is covered in soft, handwoven
{Wcarpet{x so that it will protect a crawling baby's knees.

completing the hallway.  The {rr{Re{rd{x carpet also stops here at the doors,
connecting to another carpet dyed a light shade of {gg{Gree{gn{x.  Nooks have been
built into the walls, similar to the rest of the hall, to hold more
masterpieces and ancient works.  One of them supports a small {Wstatue{x of a
woman with braided hair holding a bow skillfully in her hands.

The Master Suite~
The master bedroom of the manor is a work of art in itself.  It is
decorated in hues of light {Ggr{ge{Gen{x and {mpu{Mrp{mle{x, giving it an almost springtime
appeal.  Adding to this decor are large vases of {Mor{mc{Gh{mi{Mds{x and other tropical
flowers in colors to match the room.  They are scattered around on various
dressing tables and nightstands.  The {yfurniture{x is all grand and expensive,
carved from {yw{Ya{ylnut{x and dark {Dash{x, resting on incredibly soft, pale {Ggr{ge{Gen{x
carpet.  The ceiling has been patterned after noble rooms in the {Wpalace{x and
is inlaid with rich, {ywooden{x moulding and frescoes depicting {yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x history. 
The lights are almost hidden by these paintings, giving the room a soft,
romantic glow.  Grand double patio doors lead to a balcony to the south.

This is most likely one of the largest closets you have ever seen.  There
are dozens of shelves and drawers holding all kinds of apparel, ranging from
{Wcottons{x to {bve{Blve{bts{x to {ys{Yilk{ys{x.  Most of the more private items are housed in
the drawers.  There are also a half dozen ten foot rails, each filled with
hanging clothing, mostly coats and gowns.  All kinds of shoes and {Dboots{x are
neatly lined against the walls.  Everything in the closet it neatly mended

tile arranged in a checkered pattern.  Two personal sinks have been built
into {Wtiled{x cabinets that line the eastern wall.  They are drained by {Dpi{wpe{Ds{x
that run through the walls to the outside of the house, similar to the
system in the kitchen.  A large {yg{Yi{Wld{Ye{yd{x mirror hangs above the sinks,
reflecting the room and making it appear larger.  There is also a lady's
vanity pushed against the northern wall.  It holds {mbo{Mttl{mes{x of all shapes and
sizes as well as other personal toiletries.

finely crafted coat {yracks{x in each corner of the room.  It is their job to do
whatever possible to make guests comfortable.  The room itself is very
lavish and cozy.  A large, plush {Gr{Du{Gg{x dominates the center of the room,
cushioning each step against the {yha{rrd{ywood{x floor.  The walls are hung with
elegant {ypo{Wrtrai{yts{x of family members and historical events that this noble
family is proud of.  A large {rf{Rir{Ye{Wp{Yl{Rac{re{x decorates the north wall, lighting
the room and also keeping it at a comfortable temperature.

beautiful.  Looking down, one can see the manor's garden, overlooking spiral
cut {gt{Gr{ye{Ge{gs{x and mounts of {mwi{Mld{Wflo{Mwe{mrs{x.  In the distance, the {Bblue{x banners of
the {Wpalace{x flap in the ocean breeze above the towers.  This is the perfect

the distance, you can see new manors being constructed for the younger
generation of {yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x noblity.  The homes are merely {yframes{x for the moment,
but the sound of hammers pounding {Dn{wai{Dls{x signifies that they will be done in

A Noble Manor~
Inside this large manor is a collection of masterpieces and
craftsmanship.  Although the home is smaller than some of the others, no
expense has been spared.  The entry is decorated all in {Wm{ya{Yr{Wb{yl{Ye{x and expensive
{yw{Yo{yods{x, with {gmu{Gra{gls{x painted on the ceiling and the walls depicting heroes and
legends that seem larger than life.  The floor is covered in a rich {Wwhite{x
marble, woven with {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn{x mineral strands that make the room bright and
extravagant.  A huge {yg{Yol{yd{x chandelier hangs from the ceiling, giving the room
a soft, dramatic glow.

Brigette stands as the highlight on the wall, with a {Wradiating{x glow about
her.  On the opposite wall is a very large {rf{Rir{Ye{Wp{Yl{Rac{re{x, burning brightly to
light and also to warm the room.  On its mantle stands treasures from around
the world, ranging from {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn{x statues to {Wi{Yv{Wory{x tusks and large {rg{Rem{rs{x.  This

A Noble's Bedroom~
This bedroom is massive.  It is probably twice the size of any other
noble bedroom on Royal Road.  Obviously, the noble that lives here is a bit
vain, because there are three large standing {cmi{Cr{Wr{Co{crs{x, gilded with {rch{ye{rrry{x
wood, scattered around the room in various places.  Next to each is a small
dressing {ytable{x that holds small bottles of {mpe{Mrfum{mes{x and other neccesities. 
A large window on the southern wall is partially open, allowing a cool
breeze to refresh the room.  The {bcu{Brtai{bns{x that hang from the rod above it

it nears the top.  The {Bo{Cc{We{Ca{Bn{x comes right up next to this piece of landscape,
almost reaching the top of the hill when the waves are fiercest.  Someday,
this part of {yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x will be eroded away, perhaps becoming a beach.  Until
then, a {Wsandy{x path continues to the west.

Nearing the Top of a Tall Ocean Cliff~
You have almost reached the top of the hill and notice that a sheer drop
of about two hundred feet has eroded the hill to the south.  It has formed
after years and years of waves have crashed against this hilltop.  It is not
a very safe place to stand, but those who dare can admire a breathless {Bo{Cc{We{Ca{Bn{x
view with {Rs{Yu{Mn{Ws{Me{Yt{Rs{x and ships on the horizon.  When it rains, {Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{x cascades

winding path and surround large oak {gt{Gr{ye{Ge{gs{x inside small, {Wwhite{x picket fences.
There are also {givy{x plants that have been allowed to grow up the backside of
the house, giving it an aged, refined look.  Pine tress bloom around a small
{Cp{co{Cn{cd{x that is filled with {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn{x fish and a padded {yo{ga{yk{x bench sits next to the

room with a soft, rosey scent.

The Top of the Stairs~
As you ascend the stairs, the showpiece seems to grow in its niche in the
wall.  It is a very large, {yg{Yi{Wld{Ye{yd{x portrait of a beautiful woman with pale,
{Gg{Wr{Geen{x eyes and long, {ybrown{x, curly hair.  She wears a {gg{Gree{gn{x dress that is
tight and cut in {yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x fashion.  Her hands are clasped neatly in her lap
and a {cd{Wia{cm{Won{cd{x ring sparkles on her left hand.  A {yb{Yra{yss{x chandelier hangs in
the center of the ceiling above the stairs.  It lights the portrait
perfectly.  A rail of {ysu{Yng{ywood{x surrounds the staircase, creating a balcony
of sorts to look down into the entry way.  To the left of the portrait,
there is a glass door leading north and to the right of the portrait,
another staircase leads up.

{yo{Di{yl{x, most likely where this merchant has made his money.  Double glass doors

One section of the stable is walled off to store bags of oats and extra

A Large Kitchen~
An immaculately clean kitchen has been newly remodeled in the back corner
of the house.  It has all of the modern amenities, including {ym{Ya{yple{x cabinets
and countertops that are protected from carving knives by fine, {Wwhite{x tile. 
An {Ci{cc{Ce{x chest has been built into one corner of the room.  It is filled with
ice daily to keep {gf{Gr{Ru{Yi{Gt{gs{x, {ym{rea{yts{x and {gve{Gge{gta{Gbl{ges{x fresh.  Two large {Do{wv{We{Dns{x are
built into the north wall, to bake bread and other pastries throughout the
day.  The walls around them are covered with pots and pans, {Dca{wul{Ddrons{x and
bowls that hang from carefully placed hooks.

The Stalls~
This section of the stable is divided into six stalls, each holding a
{yho{Dr{Ws{ye{x.  A yard boy comes twice a day to clean these stalls and fill them
with fresh {Yhay{x.  He also cleans and fills the troughs that are built into
the gate of each stall.  The rafters of the stables hang high above the
stalls, echoing with the whinnying of horses.

The Hay Loft~
A {ywooden{x floor creates a second level to the stables, extending half way
across the rafters to the stalls.  This makes it easier for the stable boy
to push fresh {Yhay{x down to the horses.  Round bales of hay are pushed against
the wall, and square bales of hay are scattered across the floor.  {yStraw{x
also litters the floor, making it a comfortable place to take a nap and hide
from daily chores.

large {Ws{wi{Dlv{we{Wr{x chandelier that hangs in the center of a muraled ceiling.  On
the walls, above the wainscoating of highly varnished {yma{rho{yga{rny{x, hangs azure
{Bblue{x damask and oval portraits of family members.  In the center of a Domani
{Br{bu{Bg{x carpet, a {yg{Yi{Wl{yt{x table with a top of Saldaean {Do{wn{Wy{Dx{x sustains a flower
arrangement in a {bS{ce{gafo{cl{bk{x {Wporcelain{x vase tied with a rich {Bblue{x bow.

covered in light {Cblue{x paper pressed with {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn{x fleur de lis prints.  The
floor is made from {rsung{ywood{x tiles to match the stair rails outside and
covered with soft rugs woven with {cm{Ca{Wz{ce{x patterns.  On a shelf on the wall,
several small {ywooden{x horses have been carefully placed.  During playtime,

entire estate, including the new stables.  From here, you can see the
comings and goings of all those who visit the store to the north.  A

The soft scent of fresh roses fills the air when you open the door.  You
notice, as you enter the room, that the fragrance comes from two {cc{Wry{cs{Wta{cl{x
vases filled with light {Mpink{x roses.  They rest on two of the three open
window sills and add to the brightness of the room, along with the flowing,
white sheer curtains.  The room is decorated in soft {Gg{Wre{Gen{x hues, with white
mouldings and pale, almost {Wwhite{x carpet.  The overall effect of the room is
fresh and feminine.  Mother-of-pearl shells rest on shelves next to
beautiful porcelain dolls and winding mural vines of {Wwhite{x roses and soft,
{Gg{Wre{Gen{x leaves adorn the walls beneath the moulding.  The young girl that
lives in such a luxurious room is lucky indeed.

large, open windows on the northern wall that are lined with rich, {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn{x
colored {yma{Yho{yga{Yny{x.  Sheer {mdr{Map{mes{x blow lightly in the cool ocean breeze that
keeps the manor cozy.  The furniture is all handcarved and painted to match
the room.  There are shelves on the walls that hold vases of dried {mfl{Mow{mer{ms{x

ornate stripe and hung as paper on the wall.  The rugs are a Domani silk
blend of deep {bblue{x, woven with the merchant's crest in {yg{Yol{yd{x in the center. 
All the woods, moudlings and panels are carved from dark {rcherry{ywood{x.  Each
of the panels on the eastern wall holds a portrait: a beautiful woman, like
the one in the hall to the north, two charming girls and a handsome young
man.  On the southern wall, three large, square windows are open to allow a
soft {cs{Be{Wa{x breeze into the room.

of the house.  The floor is made of simple hard{ywood{x and covered with a rich
woven rug made of patterned {mpu{Mrp{mle{x triangles.  A {Ws{wi{Dlv{we{Wr{x lantern with scented

The attic is {Ddark{x and humid and is unfinished, unlike the rest of the
house.  You can see the ceiling rafters and the {yframes{x of the walls, but it
doesn't keep the merchant from storing things here.  Large {ywooden{x chests are
filled with old clothes and {Cblankets{x.  Furniture and other outdated objects
are hidden beneath large sheets of {Wcloth{x to protect them from {yd{Du{ws{yt{x.  In the

It is kept clean from {Dpi{yg{We{Don{x debris to allow the merchant and his family a
peaceful view of the northern half of the city of {yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x, or a view of
hundreds of {Ystars{x in the {Dnight{x sky.  A cool ocean {Cbr{cee{Cze{x keeps it pleasant

This new section of the merchant's shop has been added recently and
painted a rich color of {Wwhite{x, papered partially with spots of {bd{ga{br{gk{x color. 
Three large lacquer screens are scattered around the room.  They look like
lustreless {Dblack{x pools with {yg{Yol{yd{x leaves on them.  The merchant's customers
use these screens to try on the beautiful clothing that is for sale.  To
accomodate those that wait while these ornaments are tried, carefully carved
{ytables{x have been laid out on top of intricate {gr{Gug{gs{x so that conversations and
teas can be had.  A set of stairs on the east wall leads up to the storage
room.

window that composes the ceiling.  The glass is laced with {Ws{wi{Dlv{we{Wr{x to fill
the edges and hold the glass paneled {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn{x hawk in place.  On the floor,
large marbled tiles, vined with {yg{Yol{yd{x, are laid in perfect columns.  In the
center, a mosiac of a {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn{x hawk on a field of {Bblue{x echoes its reflection
above.  Two massive {yw{Yal{ynut{x doors, carved with heavy panels block the

{ywood{x as the shelves and carved in the same way.  Between these beams,
beautiful murals of a blistful city have been painted.  No desks or writing
utensils have been set up in this room.  This is because the books and

and bows have been arranged in fan shapes, squares and circles, creating
pieces of art from weapons of war.  Various Mayene shields, each bearing the
{yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn hawk{x, also decorate the walls.  Two huge columns support the {ywooden{x
ceiling beams.  Ornamental daggers wind their way up these columns, creating
a spiral illusion.  And, from the ceiling beams, colorful Mayene marching

with portraits of prominent leaders, firsts and nobles.  Small {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn{x
plaques beneath each portrait give the faces names.  Between each of these
portraits stands waist high {Wm{warbl{We{x pillars, carefully balancing busts of
other prominent people or vases of fragrant {Wf{cl{Co{Yw{Ce{cr{Ws{x.  For winter days, there
is a huge {Wm{wa{gr{Db{wl{We{x fireplace built in the west wall.  And, for general

with a thin sheen of {cd{Ce{cw{x, making it look as if it is covered in diamonds.  A
variety of {gpl{Gan{gts{x and {gt{Gr{ye{Ge{gs{x have also been planted in mounts covered with

to be a {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x wall, carved to match the foliage that surrounds it.  {YB{De{Ye{Ds{x and
butterflies dance from blossom to blossom, seeming to prefer this
beautifully simple garden to the two well-groomed, overly decorated gardens
of the {WPalace{x.  

Upon closer examination of the {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x wall, you see that it is worked in such

Huge {gt{Gr{ye{Ge{gs{x tower above you in the center of the grotto.  The shrubbery is
thick and intertwines with the long {gv{Gine{gs{x that hang from the branches on the
trees.  If the area was larger, the vines could be used to swing on.  But
since the area is more confined, the vines are unused and are growing
beautiful {Yy{ye{Yllow{x flowers.  Because the canopy of trees is so thick, puddles
of {cw{Cate{cr{x from a recent rain storm cover the ground and have not dried yet. 
You might wish to look for a drier area if you are going to have a picnic.

A Small Grotto~
The grotto begins to thin in this corner, becoming mostly {gbu{Gsh{ges{x and
{mwi{Mld{Yflo{Mwe{mrs{x.  Every once in a while, a {ysq{Du{Wi{Dr{yrel{x or a {Wbu{Mn{Wny{x scampers in the
{ggr{Geene{gry{x, making the leaves rustle.  Because there are not as many trees,
the ground is more open and this is a wonderful place for a picnic.  Someone
has also left a pile of {ywood{x here for a calm camp fire in the evening.  What
a great place to camp for the night!

A Small Grotto~
The north end of the grotto seems to be a popular place for {Rp{Wi{Rc{Wn{Ri{Wc{Rs{x - or
for lovers to enjoy some time alone.  The ground is clear beneath the {gt{Gr{ye{Ge{gs{x,
with few bushes and several {mwi{Mld{Yflo{Mwe{mrs{x.  The trees that provide shade over
head allow just enough light through their leaves to cast a romantic light
in the grotto.  In the fall, when the {Rc{Yo{gl{Yo{Rr{rs{x change and the leaves fall,
this area is breathtaking.

A Small Grotto~
Here in the center of the grotto, the {gt{yr{Ge{ye{gs{x grow tall and provide a lot
of shade.  Their canopy of branches allows just enough {Ys{Wu{Yn{x in to make the
area seem mystic and playful.  Paths weave in and out of the trees.  Some of
them are marked with boot prints from the recent {cr{Cai{cn{x when the ground was
{ym{ru{yddy{x.  One path, in particular, has bare feet prints that lead up to a
tree.  This specific tree has a {yadder{x secured to the trunk leading up into
its branches.  The humidity from the nearness to the {co{Ccea{cn{x creates the
perfect environment for {gt{Gr{ye{Ge{gs{x and {mf{Ml{Yowe{Mr{ms{x to flourish.

A Small Grotto~
The {yt{gr{Ge{ge{ys{x in the grotto are huge here.  In fact, this is a wonderful
place for bird watchers.  But, you must be quiet.  Otherwise, a slight noise
and all the birds fly away and leave only {gle{Gav{ges{x falling to the ground. 
Picking a quiet spot to observe, you might see a {rca{Wr{Rdin{ral{x or a {bb{Blu{We {Bja{by{x. 
Birds of all kinds {ynest{x in these trees, high about the ground where it is
safe.

Up a Tree~
Someone has built the most incredible tree house up here.  A very sturdy
{yladder{x has been mounted on the {yt{Gr{ge{ye trunk{x and leads up into this room.  The
tree house blends into the tree, almost as if it is a part of it.  The roof
is built around branches, so that {gl{Geave{gs{x are actually in the tree house. 
And the {ywooden{x planked walls have windows and a large door built in for easy
access.  The treehouse is simple, but the view and location is so fun. 
Children must spend hours up here just playing.

A {gG{Gro{gve{x~
A variety of {gpl{Gan{gts{x and {gt{Gr{ye{Ge{gs{x have existed in this garden for years. 
Some of the trees, Great Trees, are so tall that their sheen of crisp, {Ggreen{x
leaves could shade the pristine, soft grass beneath your feet.  However,
glistening rays of {Ysunshine{x manage to break through, flooding the grove with
dancing rays of light.  The {Gb{gu{Gs{gh{Ge{gs{x that surround the trees have been
carefully carved back so that blooming {mf{Ylo{Mw{Yer{ms{x are ever present.  The thick,
leafy {gv{Gi{gnes{x that hang from tree branches are also covered in blooms that are
trumpet shaped and filled with sweet {rn{Re{Yct{Ra{rr{x.  The ever present {cd{Ce{cw{x makes the
garden smell like a fresh, spring day, after a gentle rain storm.

A Guard Changing Station~
This room is not the guard's barracks, but it is a place for them to wait
as they prepare to take patrol.  It is a simple, {Wwhite{x room with very little
decoration.  The guards that are here can use the tables to play cards, sit
and talk or read.  Some of the tables even hold equipment, like pairs of
{Dboots{x that are being polished or {Ds{ww{Wor{wd{Ds{x that are being sharpened.  Guards
that will soon take patrol are encouraged to be here.  But, those just
getting off patrol are encouraged to go to the barracks if they plan to
sleep.

The tailor's shop is large and tidy, with two small {yplatforms{x built
against the east and west walls.  The platforms are meant for customers to
stand on to allow the tailor access to their garments so she can hem them
easier.  Floor length {cm{Cirror{cs{x hang from the walls so that clothing can be
admired while customers stand on the platforms to be fitted.  Amoung the
other pieces of furniture in the room are soft, {rve{Rlv{ret{x chairs for people who
are waiting and watching and also a couple of changing {bs{Bc{br{Be{be{Bn{bs{x.  The tailor,
herself, has a table covered with {Ds{wc{Wi{Ds{ws{Wo{Dr{ws{x and tools that she needs for

floor is barren and uncomfortable.  The only thing that stands on it are a

floor.  If you are unfortunate enough to be locked in here, you better hope

neatly tucked beneath it.  Files and {Wbr{Doc{Whures{x have been stacked perfectly
on the desk's surface.  Facing the desk, two {ywooden{x chairs stand side by
side, so that clients might discuss their tours with the guide.  The walls
are decorated with pictures of {yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x, places for visitors to go and see, if

There is obviously an outfit here for every occasion, and for some
occasions, at least a dozen outfits.  Most of the gowns are tight fitting
and clingy - befitting a {yM{Yay{We{Yne{yr{x, since they are so open about everything. 
Perhaps the largest section of clothing is the {Wnightgowns{x, one of every
color and all skimpy.  Beneath the clothes are rows of elegant heels,
slippers and boots, all perfectly fitting the feet of the {RF{Wirs{Rt{x.

purchased here.  The prices are high because importing is so expensive, but
if you have the {ym{Yone{yy{x and the desire, it is well-worth it.  All the items
have been carefully displayed and organized around the room according to the
location they have come from.  If you have any questions, the shop owner can
answer them.  He is well-traveled and knows a lot about all that he has for

This house is very old and completely barren.  A fireplace used to be
built into the west wall, but the {Ds{wt{Won{we{Ds{x that were once the mantel have
fallen and filled the pit so that it is no longer useable.  The {yw{Do{yoden{x floor
is old and decrepit, rotting in many places because of the humidity.  In one
spot, {Wte{Drm{Wi{Dt{Wes{x have completely eaten through the floor, leaving only {yd{Du{yst{x. 
Looking up, the beams in the ceiling have the same problem and look like
they might fall at any moment.  It is no wonder that this house is no longer
inhabited.

It smells rather musty.  On the south wall, you see an expanse of flashing
lights and computer screens.  Many images appear on the monitors, including
some of the more notable rooms on this mud.  You hear the faint sound of
screeching bats and water dripping in the distance.  In the middle of the
room, parked on a stone column, you see what this room was made for...  The

accessed by a metal bridge extending from the south wall to the column.  You

pausing to talk to people they know.  The buildings that line the streets
are well kept and clean, made from {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x or {rbrick{x with {Ds{wla{Dte{x roofs that
reflect the warm {Ysu{Wnshi{Yne{x.  The {Dco{wbb{Wles{wto{Dne{x road is also in good repair.

novelty and daring of the women's dresses, the piled-up colors of the

the chromatic effects of the petite {Mc{Wa{Mk{We{Ms{x behind the plate-glass of the

this section of the city.  The buildings are all made of {rbrick{x and {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x,
with {ywooden{x shutters and doors to match.  They are all very fine looking,
and should be this close to the palace.  The flowers and carved {gt{Gr{ye{Ges{x that

{yb{Yronz{ye{x statue monument built atop a tiered {Wm{wa{yr{Wb{wl{ye{x pillar.  The statue
resembles a beautiful woman standing regal and tall, her long hair blowing
in the wind.  It's oddly peaceful here, quiet and serene.  Several people

statue~
The {yb{Yronz{ye{x statue is very large, perhaps three to four times the size of
a normal human being.  Its craftsmanship can not be duplicated at this time,
leaving one to conclude that it was created during the Age of Legends.  The
woman it represents is very strong and determined.  She wears no boots or
clothes, just a drape of {yb{Yronz{ye{x material blows around her body, creating a
aura of modesty and innocence.  Perhaps she is a Hero of the Horn...  A
small plaque hangs from the third step of four on the tiered {Wm{wa{yr{Wb{wl{ye{x
pillar.  Oddly, the statue is very clean.  Birds do not perch on it out of
respect.  Only two small children climb on the stairs around the monument,
adding to its innocence.

to plant {gt{Gr{ye{Ge{gs{x along the side of the street, surrounded by {rbrick{x rails to
protect them.  Colorful {rfl{Ro{Yw{Re{rrs{x have been planted inside the rails to add
flavor and aroma to the city.

Bere Lane~
The {Dco{wbb{Wles{wto{Dne{x road weaves its way gracefully through the city, leading
to shops and houses of prominent people.  The street is lined with carefully
trimmed {gbu{Gsh{ges{x that are growing delicate {rr{Rose{rs{x, filling this section of the
city with a soft, beautiful scent.  Curious children stop to smell these
flowers, noticing their exotic appearance.  They are not a plant native to
{yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x, but have been given to the city as a gift from somewhere and they
are thriving.  Those passing down the street are careful not to harm the
plants because they are so rare and admired.

The streets in this section of {yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x are lined with more fancy shops and
large homes that belong to wealthy merchants.  The home to the south is
particularly large and well-kept with a {Wwhite{x picket fence in front and
several large, pruned {Yp{Ge{Yar {yt{gr{Ge{ge{ys{x outside.  {YBu{yt{Wt{ye{Yrcups{x surround the trees,
intermingled with {msn{Map{m d{Mrag{mons{x for color.  Not many people come to visit
this home.  Probably because its owner is out and about in the city.

Intersection of Leske Avenue and Bere Lane~
The crossroads of the {Dco{wbb{Wlest{won{Des{x streets here forms the perfect
location to conduct {yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x business.  The large {rbrick{x courthouse is to the
east.  A large sign with {ybr{Ya{yss{x letters hangs above the heavy {ywo{ro{yden{x double
doors, telling you as much.  {yWooden{x shutters have been carefully hung on
either side of the four windows on the front of the courthouse and two tall,
{Wwhite{x pillars seem to support an awning above them.  Fancy {gla{Gnd{gsc{Gap{ging{x also
adorns the front of this building.  As an official place of Mayene business,
it should be kept very nice.

The streets in this section of the city bustle with people.  Some are
standing in small groups of people, talking with friends.  Others hurry on
their way, carrying neatly wrapped {bpa{Bck{bag{Bes{x they have recently acquired from
all the shops in this section of the city.  From time to time, a very fancy
{yh{Do{yrse{x drawn {yca{Yr{Wri{Ya{yge{x will stop in front of a shop and a noble will step out
from inside.  This will cause everyone to stop and admire them briefly, but
not for too long, because this is a prosperous section of the city so there
is not much cause for envy.

here, leading to other streets and shops.  It looks almost like this section
of the city has just been completed, because gardeners are busy at work
planting {mf{Mlo{Yw{Mer{ms{x and {gt{Gr{ye{Ge{gs{x to beautify the city.  With all the work going
on, one would think that citizens would stay away, but they are curious to
explore the new additions to {yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x.

{wCenter of the City of {yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x~
The center of the city is a convergence of all the major roads, creating
a large plaza in which is centered a massive fountain.  The {Dco{wbb{Wles{wto{Dne{x road
circles the fountain, serving as a turn about for those driving {ywagons{x and
wishing to go down side streets.  Because it is the center of the city,
people congregate here, watching performers, talking to friends and trying
to find their way.  Natives use the {Wpalace{x as a barring.  The towers, with
their huge {bba{Bnne{brs{x, are visable to the north.  And {csa{Cilo{crs{x come and go from
the south, letting those who are lost know that the ports are in that
direction.

hustling and bustling here and there.  The shops that line the road are

west.  Patrons come and go most frequently during the lunch and evening

The beautifully laid {Dco{wbb{Wles{wto{Dne{x road stretches onto one of the most
prosperous streets in the city.  Two-story homes line the road, with their
carefully maintained landscapes that look like they belong in a story.  The
{gt{Gr{ye{Ge{gs{x are trimmed and pruned to perfection.  One of the larger ones even has
a {Wbench swing{x hanging from the branches.  Carefully selected {mf{Ml{Yo{Ww{Ye{Mr{ms{x have
been planted around the trees and in bunches around the yard, filling the
air with a soft fragrance.  And, {rr{Ro{rse {gbu{Gsh{ges{x bloom along {Wwhite{x picket
fences, with blossoms so large one flower could fill a vase.  This truly is
a wonderful place to own a home.

right shop in the right location.  All of the buildings are made of {rbrick{x,
with {ywooden{x shutters open to allowing a cooling breeze inside.  {gGr{Gas{gs{x lines
the street outside of these homes and is freshly cut each week to maintain a
cared for appearance.  Twice a year, new {Mpe{Wr{Yi{Ww{Min{Wk{Yl{Mes{x are planted and allowed

The {Dco{wbb{Wles{wto{Dne{x road is calmer here, because it is not so close to the
busy center of the city.  To the south, the road narrows and leads to a more
private section of homes.  It is lined with {gt{Gr{ye{Ge{gs{x on either side, providing
ample shade and making it very pleasant to travel down.  To the east, the
large {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn{x gates loom to the eastern entrance to the city of {yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x.  Gate
guards control the traffic in order to keep this section of the city more
calm.

freely under the watchful eye of the {Rg{Wa{Rte g{Wu{Ra{Wr{Rds{x.  At night, the gates are
closed and only open at the patrol's discretion.  {yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x's biggest threat is
Tear.  The city is known to protect itself from this threat through the use
of Daes Dae'mar.  However, that is not enough.  These gates, guards and
ocean and tower patrols also work over time to keep the city free from
attack.

Massive {yg{Yol{yd{x gates stand open, welcoming you to the city of {yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x.  Not
surprisingly, {Rg{Wa{Rte g{Wu{Ra{Wr{Rds{x watch you enter, ensuring that you pose no threat
to their beloved city.  If you are not Tairen, they will more than likely
let you pass without question.  These gates are one set of two that allow
travelers into the city.  Because Mayene is a city-state, it consists of
only one city and a few leagues of land.  This makes it harder to defend,
but with ship patrols and guards constantly keeping an eye on things,
invasion does not look like it will be a problem.

A large map of the {Cw{go{yr{gl{Cd{x has been painted on the entire east wall.  It is
quite a sight to behold...  So many places to travel and all of them with
their own people and culture.  The shop is nicely designed, with large
windows on the south wall to allow a lot of light into the room.  The middle
window is open, letting a gentle breeze sweep into the room and ruffle
{Wpapers{x on a {yha{rrd{ywood desk{x.  The desk sits a top a {br{Bu{bg{x that does not look
native to {yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x.  But then, all of the knick knacks displayed on {yshelves{x
around the room are from around the world, so the agent probably purchased
the rug on one his journeys.

This common room is filled with laughter and voices at all hours of the

is very tidy.  The {yha{rrd{ywood{x floors are always cleanly swept and the tables

houses thieves and beggars, they still go to the ports, knowing that the

Intersection of Palace Road and Chester Boulevard~
This section of Chester Boulevard connects with Palace Road, and
therefore, leads to the docks to the south.  The riff raff of the poor end
of the town still pass here, but they are careful to ignore those that pass
by in nice clothing.  The rare noble that passes this way will not even

fairly clean.

Chester Boulevard~
The worn {Ds{wt{Wre{we{Dt{x rustles with dirty {ya{Dn{wi{ym{Da{wl{ys{x and tired-looking people
wearing mismatched clothing in disrepair.  The buildings to the north and
south are black with {Dsoot{x, no telling what their original color was.  {DL{wi{Dt{wt{De{wr{x

it is completely ignored by the passerby's, except for the occasional dog or

The filthy {Dco{wbb{Wles{Wto{Dne{x street is covered in {yd{Di{yrt{x and {Dl{wi{Dt{wt{De{wr{x.  Pigeons and
an occational mouse peek from beneath a wrinkled {W{yape{wr{x, looking for crumbs. 
Amidst the mess, {Dsoot{x covered buildings arise.  Most of them are deserted,
with {yboards{x covering the windows and doors, though this doesn't keep people
from living in them.  At least two of the buildings are being used.  One
with bars on the windows and other, to the south, with its door open.  The
building to the south was landscaped once, but the {rb{Dri{rck{x enclosed gardens
are now overgrown with rotting {yw{ge{yeds{x.

To Ports~
This is the only street leading from the city to the ports, therefore, it
is very busy.  The {Dco{wbb{Wles{wto{Dne{x looks worn, but is in good repair.  {yWagons{x
travel back and forth, carrying goods that will be shipped to other cities. 
Crates are also arriving that will be delivered to {yM{Ya{wye{Yn{ye{x shops so the
produce can be sold.  To the east, a small shop has been built from {Dt{wi{Wn{x.  It
looks like it has been here for a while, but the {cs{Ce{ca{x air isn't doing
anything to rot its exterior.  A sign out front reads "{gFishing Supplies{x."

Chester Boulevard~
The crowded, trash filled street doesn't look all that much different
from the rest of the streets in the southern end of the city.  Everything is
{Ddark{x, old and dirty.  To the north stands an old, {Yyellow{x-brick house. 
During its time, it was a show piece for high society.  People came to gawk
at the new style of {Ds{wl{Wa{wt{De{x shingle and the {Wwhite{x shudders that still decorate
the windows.  Now, the house is still charming, but it is covered in the

The bustling city street is filled with people dodging {yw{Wag{yons{x and
carriages pulled by thin horses.  These vehicles carry supplies, {ybarrels{x and
battered furniture for moving families.  Dirty, flea-bitten {yan{Wi{Dm{Yals{x dart
this way and that, trying to avoid crushing wheels.  At night, they come out
to feast on the litter and stale food that has been left in the street.  To
the south, there is a rickety building that looks inhabited.  To the east, a

Humidity makes the {yd{Dir{yt{x on the {Dco{wbb{Wlest{won{Des{x turn to {ymud{x so that this
section of the city becomes even messer.  The {Dblackness{x of the mud mimicks
the {Dsoot{x covered buildings that are deserted and look as if they are about
to fall over.  {rBr{Dic{rks{x have become dislodged from their sides and many of the
roofs have collapsed into the buildings that they once sheltered.  A
moderate sized hole has been created in the side of one building by pulling
out loose bricks.  It is just the right size for stray animals or a small
person to enter and take shelter inside the less than sturdy walls.

Intersection of Chester Boulevard and Parker Street~
The real estate in this end of the city is dirt cheap - literally.  No
one wants to live here and those that do can not afford to live anywhere
else.  {DSh{wan{Dti{we{Ds{w and {yshacks{x have been built up behind once prosperous
buildings now covered in {yd{rir{yt{x and {Dsoot{x.  The {Dco{wbb{Wles{wto{Dne{x street out front is
in such disrepair that it is nearly impossible to drive a wagon over it. 
Mostly, people wearing mismatched clothing travel this mess by foot, hoping
to make a living by begging or scrounging what they can.

here, in full bloom.  Their branches shade the {Dco{wbb{Wles{wto{Dne{x street so that
passersby can enjoy their stroll.  Very close to the south is the {Wpalace
{gco{Gur{Wt{Gya{grd{x, a place for guests and royals to enjoy the beauty of an inner
garden.  Animals also folick there and occationally stray out onto this road
to play in the {bf{Blo{yw{Yer{Bin{bg{x bushes.  To the north, a well-groomed cobblestone
street stretches out to farm land and eventually, to the drowned lands.

fly above the {Wpalace{x.  To the west, a path leads to a large {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x building

The road from the north begins to take shape as it leads into the city of
{yM{Ya{Wye{Yn{ye{x.  It is lined with small {Dg{wr{Wa{Dn{wi{Wt{De{x stones and large, shady oak {gt{Gr{ye{Ge{gs{x
that look as old as the city itself.  There are ever present puddles of {ym{ru{yd{x
in the middle of the path, reminants of the drowned lands to the north. 
Creatures of all kinds seem attracted to this dirty {Cw{ca{Dt{ce{Cr{x, but they will not
venture into the city itself.  

{yMa{Yy{Wen{Ye{yrs{x rarely enter this end of the city, since the usual route is to
travel to Godun in Tear and then take a ship to their homeland.  Because the
journey is so intensive, many Mayeners never leave.  Only those brave

It is this way partially as a protection, but mostly to allow for the {BP{Wo{Brt

{Wan{yi{Rm{Wals{x, preserved foods and other materials that will be loaded onto ships.
Passengers carry {ylu{Wg{Dg{yage{x and push their way through the crowds waving passes
to show that they have access to board the vessels.  Children thrive in this
throng, pushing their way to the edge of the docks so they can feed the
{Rf{Yi{rs{Rh{x, or some of them even picking pockets.  The crowd thickens to the east
and west, stretching further onto the docks.  The center of the city is far

#HELPS
0 BUILDER_COSTS~
These are suggestions and should be altered depending on the area, the 
object and the builder. It is alright to alter them :)

Remember that necessities should be less expensive than luxuries.

{WCLOTHING{x (should be commensurate with type of clothing)
newbie clothes .....................................   0
cotton clothes .....................................  45
woolen clothes .....................................  60
leather clothes ....................................  85
leather armor  ..................................... 150
chainmail armor .................................... 250
plate armor ........................................ 300

Weapons should cost between 150 and 300 depending on material and 
craftsmanship.

{WFOOD{x (should be commensurate with food hours)

a loaf of bread, a pie, a piece of fruit, candy ... 10-15 silver
                                and should last ... 2-4 hours
hunk of meat or cheese, a meal, rations ........... 15-25 silver
                                and should last ... 4-6 hours

tea, lemonade, normal drinks ......................  5-10 silver
alcohol ........................................... 15-30 silver
barrels of drink ..................................   250 silver

{WLIGHTS AND LANTERNS{x (should be commensurate with light time)
a torch ...........................................  40 silver
                                and should last ...  2 hours
a lantern ......................................... 100 silver
                                and should last ...  5 hours

A light that never goes out should be set with a v2 of -1. These 
types of lights should be expensive or found on higher level mobs.
 
{WWATER/CANTEENS{x 
(should be commensurate with how much the container/fountain holds)

a small canteen ................................... 60-70 silver
                           and should hold (v0) ... 5-6 drinks
a large canteen ................................... 120-140 silver
                           and should hold (v0) ... 10-12 drinks

A fountain or never-ending canteen (which should only be a quest 
item) should have the v0 and v1 values of 100000. This way, they 
never run out.

{WMOBS{x

The amount of silver carried by a mob should be determined by the 
type of mob. Animals, trollocs and fades should not have a wealth 
value. Other mobs can be separated into other categories: poor, 
working-class, middle-class and wealthy. As an estimation, areas 
should be 30% poor, 30% working-class, 25% middle-class and 15% 
wealthy.
 
Examples:
A street urchin or a begger is poor.
A farmer, sailor, drunk or soldier is working-class.
A shop keep might be middle-class.
A mayor or noble would be wealthy.

Working-Class     0-15 silver                   0-30 silver
Middle-Class      0-25 silver                   0-45 silver
Wealthy           0-50 silver                   0-150 silver

0 WALL OF FIRE~
Level: 90

Syntax: c 'wall of fire' <direction> OR c wall <direction>

This weave of {WAir{x and {RFire{x creates a stationary barrier of fire that burns 
hot enough to prevent even the bravest souls from passing through it.  While
being near one does not incur any damage, attempting to pass one will result
in severe burns in addition to repulsing the would-be penetrator.

0 WALL OF AIR~
Level: 90 

Syntax: c 'wall of air' <direction> 

This weave of {WAir{x and {BWater{x creates a stationary barrier that appears to be
a {Cbluish haze{x.  While no harm will come when attempting to pass through one,
no success will come either.

0 vorpal~
Vorpal is a weapon modifier used to signify increased opportunity to
remove someone's head or the like, however, given the non-applicability to
the world of Wheel of Time, it currently does nothing within the customized
battle code we use.

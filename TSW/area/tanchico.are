The most noticeable thing about this corridor inside the School of
Illuminators is the faint smell of sulfur that hangs in the air.  The walls
of the corridor have been left as bare brick apart from the decorative hooks
attached to them which hold ornate oil lamps made of brass.  There are
several identical doorways leading off from this corridor, each one has
worrying singe marks around the doorframe and its base.

that has been carved from dark wood.  Numerous dark wooden desks and chairs
which have been arranged in neat rows fill the classroom.  Lastly there are
two gray stone fireplaces built into the walls that are adjacent to the

This brown brick chamber within the School of Illuminators is being used
as an office by the School Master.  The office is roughly square in shape
and has been half-paneled with dark wood and dark green tiles cover the
floor in a checkered pattern.  As well as shelves filled with books and
ornaments, the walls have been used to display a multitude of certificates
and diplomas that have all been decoratively framed and hung with pride. 
Numerous trophies have been placed along the mantelpiece of the wide gray
stone fireplace on the north side of the room while at the opposite side are
a pair of tall arched windows that look out over a large area of grassy land
that appears to be used as a practice area for the Illuminators.

palaces and halls topped with thin towers or pointed domes all built around
the mouth of the River Andahar and Tanchico Bay.  The white stone walls that
encompass the city add to the wondrous effect of the historic coastal city

This thoroughfare is one of the busiest areas in Tanchico as it joins
together the three peninsulas that make up the city.  The road is quite wide
and has been built using slabs of dull gray stone.  Strange buildings with
flat roofs line the road, nearly all of them have white plaster covering
their outer walls.  Many of the buildings along this road are houses but
there are also shops, inns and taverns too.  Beyond the sprawl of low
buildings are the city's magnificent white stone palaces and mansions
created with intricately thin towers and pointed domes.

At this point the east/west street known as Tanchico Road intersects a
north/south thoroughfare known as King's Road.  The white structures that
flank the gray stone roads offer a scene that could rival Whitebridge at a

close up.  Only the towers and palaces are made of stone, all of the other

This is a broad thoroughfare paved that leads through the northern part
of Tanchico and joining together the three hilly peninsulas that the coastal
city is built upon.  The city is awash with white buildings, from
needle-like towers, glorious palaces with gilded domes to more simple homes
with flat roofs.  This section of the city mainly consists of shops and
taverns although the odd tall house belonging to wealthy citizens can be
seen here too.

Beyond a tall gray stone wall that looks out of place amongst the white
buildings of Tanchico is the Illuminators' Guild, a complex of buildings
which is almost a village in its own right.  The collection of brickwork
houses and workshops lies beyond this arched gatehouse, a plain construction
with no carvings or embellishments.  A wide road paved with slabs of gray
stone passes underneath the gatehouse, linking Tanchico's road network with
that of the Illuminators' complex.

This is a wide road that winds its way through the Illuminator's complex.
The road passes a cluster of small brick buildings with flat roofs which
appear to be houses.  The Illuminator abodes lack the coating of white
plaster upon their exterior walls that the rest of the city houses have in
their vain attempt at mimicking Tanchico's white stone halls and palaces.

This is the east end of a long road that winds its way through a network
of buildings belonging to the Illuminators' Guild.  The road has been paved
with smooth slabs of gray stone and is in a much better state of repair than
Tanchico's thoroughfares.  To the east is a large building that appears to
the Illuminators' Guild Hall.

The grandest of all the structures within the Illuminators' Complex is
the Guild Hall.  It is a very tall and austere building made from brown
brick.  The main entrance of the building and its connecting corridors are
half-paneled with dark wood and dark green tiles cover the floor in a
checkered pattern.  The vaulted ceiling has been painted dark blue like the
night's sky and embossed with a pattern of gilded stars.  On the west side
of this chamber is a tall pair of doors that leads outside of the building.

This brown brick chamber within the Guild Hall is being used as an office
by the Head Illuminator.  The office is roughly square in shape and has been
half-paneled with dark wood and dark gray, almost black tiles cover the
floor in a checkered pattern.  A golden lantern hung from the ceiling bathes
the long dark wood book shelves and richly colored tapestries that adorn the
walls with a soft golden light.  There is a wide black marble fireplace on
the west side of the room while at the opposite side are a pair of tall
arched windows that look out over a large area of grassy land that appears
to be used as a practice area for the Illuminators.

The Illuminators' Chapter House is a long rectangular chamber within the
Guild Hall whose walls have almost entirely been covered with dark wood
paneling.  A wide aisle that leads down the center of the chamber between
two rows of wide black marble columns has been marked out by a strip of
plush crimson carpet while the columns help support the vaulted white
plastered ceiling and grand domed roof of the Chapter House.  Long colorful
tapestries hang from the walls of the chamber, each one depicting a night
scene of different cities beneath colorful displays of Illuminators'
nightflowers.  The grandest of the illustrations is within the tall arched
window that makes up most of the western wall of the chamber that is filled
with a stained glass design of the city of Tanchico.

while at the opposite side are a pair of tall arched windows that look out
over a large area of grassy land that is used as a practice area for the

This is a large vault located somewhere within the Illuminator's complex.
Like most areas of the complex, the walls of the room have been left bare
brown brickwork and dark gray cover the floor.  The vault is brightly
illuminated by small oil lanterns that hang from the ceiling.  Numerous
chests, crates and boxes have been stacked up neatly along the north side of
the room whilst small hessian sacks have been stacked at the opposite side
of the room.  The only visible exit from the vault is an iron braced door on
the west side of the room.

The most noticeable thing about this corridor within the School of
Illuminators is the faint aroma of sulfur that hovers in the air.  The walls
have been left as bare brick except for the ornamental hooks attached to
them which hold elaborate oil lamps made of brass.  There are several exits
from this corridor including a set of double doors at the west end that lead
outside the building and several smaller doorways that have been marred with
dark scorch marks around their frames.

A strong smell of sulfur fills the air of this workshop.  A window at the
north side of the room would have been enough to illuminate the room by day
if it were not boarded up.  There are scorch marks around the window that
hint of what might have happened in this room.  A door at the south end of
the room provides a welcome exit out of this workshop, little needs to be
said about the state of the wall it apart from it looks like someone has

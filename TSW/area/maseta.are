King's Road is Maseta Peninsula's main thoroughfare.  It is a broad road
paved with gray stone and overlooked by snowy white buildings.  The majority
of these buildings have white plaster covering their exterior walls but the
grander and more ornate structures have been built from white stone.  In the
distance to the southwest is the King's Palace, a huge sprawling palace
whose majestic walls and tapering towers have been made from solid stone.

The city of Tanchico is full of famous landmarks and one such sight is on
the west side of King's Road.  The great sprawling white stone building
known as the King's Palace towers over the rest over every other building in
the area.  It would be of little surprise to those familiar with Tarabon to
find the white stone complex containing the headquarters of the King's Life
Guard at the opposite side of the road.

King's Road is Maseta Peninsula's main thoroughfare.  It is a broad road
paved with dull gray stone and flanked by snowy white buildings.  Nearly all
of these buildings have white plaster covering their outer walls but the
grander and more ornate structures have been built from white stone.  Two of
Tanchico's famous landmarks are situated near this point, to the northwest
is the King's Palace and to the south is the King's Circle.

This is the north lobby located in the King's Circle, the largest of
Tanchico's three vast stadiums.  Although it is the biggest of the stadiums,
the grand white stone structure is not as tall as the King's Palace that
lies elsewhere on the Maseta Peninsula.  A wide gallery follows the entire
inner circumference of the building with tall yet slender arched windows
looking out over the arena floor.  There are elaborate reliefs of scenes of
battles in Tarabon's past carved into the outer wall of the gallery.  Lastly
there is a barred gateway built into the inner wall which is all that stands
in the way of accessing the arena floor.

The arena floor is a huge circular field of hard-packed dirt that is
enclosed inside the white stone structure of the King's Circle.  The inner
wall is roughly fifteen feet in height and has elaborate friezes of horse
races and other grand events that are held within the massive building. 
Behind the inner wall are the spectators' seats that form concentric circles
around the arena, rising like steps of white stone.  Four arched gateways
built into the inner wall appear to be the only routes in or out of the
arena floor.

Most of the buildings that lie on the Maseta Peninsula are old and
rundown with parts of their exterior plasterwork flaking off to reveal their
brown masonry.  The ones that border this wide stone-paved road however seem
to be in better condition than the ones built south of here.  One of
Maseta's most well-known landmarks lies just north of this point, the King's
Circle.

As its name suggests, Maseta Road is located on the Maseta Peninsula.  It
is a broad yet curved thoroughfare that has been paved with slabs of dull
gray stone.  The road is joined by a network of much narrower streets that
weave their way between white plastered buildings.  The buildings here are
unusual, they possess flat roofs and none of the houses have windows
overlooking the streets.  There are a few shops dotted around the area but
they are mostly old and rundown ones.

Maseta Road is a broad thoroughfare clad with dull gray paving slabs. 
The road is long and curves gently as it leads around the southern half of
the Maseta Peninsula.  Narrow streets and alleys lead off from this
thoroughfare but none are wide enough to accommodate an average sized wagon.
The shops and houses within this district are squat structures with flat
roofs and have white plaster covering their exterior walls; the houses are
easily distinguishable from the shops because they have no windows facing
onto the streets.

large slabs of gray stone.  The road is joined by a series of narrower
streets and alleyway that do not look wide enough for an average sized cart

This general store is dank, dusty and full of clutter.  The white plaster
used to cover the walls has turned a grimy gray color from dirt and the bare
wooden floorboards have not fared any better.  Holes in the ceiling where
the plaster has rotted away reveal the wooden lathing.  The room is
dominated by a large counter placed in the center of the room and is
surrounded by several wooden shelves and racks that have been fixed to the
walls.  Each shelf is used to display the shop's merchandise although most
of it is arranged in a haphazard manner.

with many of the people that live and work nearby.  Dented oil lanterns hung
from the wooden rafters cast a subtle yellow glow over the large common
room.  The walls have been left as bare brown brickwork but the wooden
floorboards have been strewn with a layer of sawdust.  A welcoming fireplace
built from brick sits at one side of the room while several barrels of rum,
ale and wine have been stacked against the opposite wall.

Palace, an impressive construction of white stone built with tapering
towers, arabesque balconies and grand archways.  Tall fluted columns made of
white marble border the courtyard, and in turn the columns are bordered by
magnolias.  Three roads lead off from the courtyard but the one of most
interest is the broad thoroughfare that leads down the side of the hill
towards the main gateway.

There are large areas of lush lawns surrounded by elaborate topiaries but

flowers that have been brought here from all around the known world.  The
perimeter wall is broken along its west side by wide iron gates; beyond the

and functional.  There are dozens of stalls lining the north and south sides

storage of carriages and other equipment.  There is only one exit from this
building, a wide set of doors on the east side that lead out into a

offering room for the assistants to work and temporarily store the dishes
ready to be served.  In the center of the first area, there is a square
mahogany table with a pristine white tablecloth on it.  On top of it, there
is a basket of fruits, a tray with fresh bread and another with a fresh
vanilla cake.  Two rectangular ice chests which are as tall as the counter
stand on the corner, storing perishable food and cooled drinks.  A small
door close to the entrance takes to the pantry while the other by its side
is a storage room.

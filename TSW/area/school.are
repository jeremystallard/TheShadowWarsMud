creature grolm~
a {Dg{gr{Do{gl{Dm{x~
A hideous three-eyed creature is watching you...
~
Weighing in at three hundred to five hundred pounds, grolm are the size
of large bears, but with the {Dgray{x-{gg{Gre{gen{x coloration and skin texture of very
tough frogs.  They have three eyes that are small and fierce, looking like
they lack intelligence, and are ringed by hard ridges.  Their horny-lipped
beaks are hooked for ripping flesh.  

When walking, grolm appear almost awkward, moving with a waddling motion,
but all traces of awkwardness vanish when they run, taking great leaps and
bounds that propel them over the ground at great speed.  They also have very
good vision, a keen sense of smell, and are extremely territorial.  Because
of these characteristics they make excellent guard animals.  They rapidly
learn who is allowed in a given area, and will use their sense of smell to
distinguish anyone who is nervous or afraid.

Newbie School Entrance~
This is a huge circular chamber with exits leading in all many
directions.  Lighting the chamber are several oil lanterns placed at
intervals around the room to ensure that the room is always well lit.  The
walls of the chamber have been painted a pale shade of blue and the floor of
the chamber has been paved with polished white tiles.  Around the inner
perimeter of the chamber is a spiraling staircase, carved from white marble
that coils off in both directions.

The {rN{Re{Wwb{Ri{re{x School Tutorial:  Part 1 - Rooms & Movement~
Greetings and welcome to the {rN{Re{Wwb{Ri{re{x School Tutorial, a guide to some of
the more common commands used on this MUD to help you get started on your
journey.  By typing {WExit{x you will be able to see all available exits from
the room you are standing in.  Moving around your environment is simple by
using the compass directions {WNorth{x, {WEast{x, {WSouth{x and {WWest{x, which can be
abbreviated to {Wn{x, {We{x, {Ws{x, {Ww{x.  Respectively.  There are also two other
directions to be familiar with, {WUp{x and {WDown{x; {Wu{x and {Wd{x.  To look at the
description of the room or area you are in, simply type {WLook{x, which can also
be abbreviated to {Wl{x.

Communication is an essential part of a MUD.  It is used for
role-playing, asking for help or general chat.  To make it easier to
understand the different aspects of communication, this lesson has been
split into four parts.  Look at the sign in the room to find out where each
of the lessons is being held.

The {rN{Re{Wwb{Ri{re{x School Tutorial:  Part 2a - OOC & IC~
OOC and IC are two very common terms that are used frequently.  IC means
in character and applies to role-playing.  OOC means out of character and
applies to matters not related to role-play.  It is commonplace for any OOC
knowledge not to be used as IC knowledge or matters with IC character
development gets really confusing.  Communication channels are put into one
of either of these two categories for example, to speak to a character in
the same room as you role-play, use the "{Wsay{x" command.  But to talk
to that person out of character, use the "{Wosay{x" command to avoid any
confusion.

The {rN{Re{Wwb{Ri{re{x School Tutorial:  Part 2b - The Channels~
Channels are a means of communicating with other characters, some
channels are considered as IC, some are considered as OOC.  To talk to one
character anywhere in the world use the "{Wtell{x" command.  To communicate with
all characters use the "{Wchat{x" command.  Both of these channels are
considered as OOC.  For IC communications "{WGossip{x" will allow you to talk to
all characters.  These are only a few of the many channels that are
available.  To find out more, use the "{WHelp{x" command and check out the
relative information.  

New players have access to the "{MNewbie{x" channel where questions can be asked
related to the game or any other question that new players should have.  

The "{WPray{x" channel is a mean to directly communicate to the Immortals.

Perhaps on your journey into the world you will be traveling in a group
with other characters.  To talk to the other members of your group, simply
use the "{Wgt{x" command.  To find out more relevant information about groups
and grouping, check out "{WHelp{x" and "{WHelp Group{x" for more details.

The {rN{Re{Wwb{Ri{re{x School Tutorial:  Part 2d - Help~
If you are stuck in any part of the mud and are unsure of what to do,
don't panic.  First check out the help files using the "{WHelp{x" command.  If
what you are looking for is not there, try talking to the players on the
relevant OOC channel.  If you are still unsure of what to do, finally the
pray channel is another way of getting help.  Use the "{WPray{x" command and if
an immortal is around, they will help you with your inquiry.

The {rN{Re{Wwb{Ri{re{x School Tutorial:  Part 3 - Objects~
You should now be familiar with rooms and communication so this next
lesson should be really easy.  Over the course of your journey you will find
various types of objects.  An object can have many properties and
attributes, some beneficial; some could even be harmful.  Whether or not an
object will be useful to you is a question for you to find out.  To find out
more about interacting with objects, look at the chart on the wall (Use
"{WLook Chart{x").  Look at the sign on the wall to find out more about common
objects.  When you are ready, head down to the next lesson.

The {rN{Re{Wwb{Ri{re{x School Tutorial: Part 3a - Food & Drink~
Among the different types of objects you will encounter during your
journey, perhaps the most essential ones are foods and drinks.  Making sure
that your character is well fed and refreshed can improve your natural
healing abilities.  In short, if you are hungry, you are going to heal
really slowly after a battle unless you eat some food and drink some water. 
As well as drinking from fountains, you can carry your own supply of water
with you for emergencies, but remember to fill your container.  There are
other drinkable liquids besides water, some of which have very bizarre
effects indeed.  To find out more about interacting with food and drink
items, look at the chart on the wall.

Containers are very useful items.  Not only can you find all sorts of
hidden treasures lurking within the depths of some containers, but also they
are useful for storing your own items.  To find out more about containers,
read the chart upon the wall, then see if you can find what's within the
wardrobe.

Light sources are another type of useful item that you will probably find
on your travels.  It helps to have a source of light when exploring dark
regions.  There is a down side as some light sources have a limited life
span and could end up leaving you in the dark.  To find out more about light
equipment, read the {wc{Whar{wt{x upon the wall.  Don't forget to look inside the

The {rN{Re{Wwb{Ri{re{x School Tutorial:  Part 3d - Equipment~
Equipment is essential as you travel on you journey, and you will find it
along the way.  Good armor and clothing gives you resistance from attacks. 
A good weapon can inflict more damage than a poorly made one.  As you gain
experience and levels from fighting mobs, the type of armor and weapons you
can use tends to get better.  Some items have other special affects that
could benefit or hinder your character and his development.  What those
items are and where they will be found is up to you to discover, but always
remember to check your newly gained equipment in case it does more harm than
good.  As well as reading the chart, don't forget to check the wardrobe in
this room, just in case someone has left something inside it.

Here are a few helpful hints to help you on your way before you head
down to your final lesson:

Type "{Wauto{x" for a status list of automatic functions your character can
perform.  Typing the name of each function toggles them on and off.  "{WTitle{x"
sets your title on the player list (type "{Wwho{x" to see who else is logged on
the Mud).  "{WIctitle{x" sets your IC title, so remember to use something that
is in character.  Type "{Wcommands{x" to give you a list of the commands used on
this Mud and don't forget to check the help files if you want more
information about them.

The {rN{Re{Wwb{Ri{re{x School Tutorial:  Part 5 - Mobiles~
Here is a crash course in combat.  Use the "{Wwimpy{x" command to set the
amount of hp you have left before you flee from combat.  Always make sure to
check your equipment.  There is nothing worse than starting combat and
forgetting to wield a weapon.  Non-player characters on Muds are generally
known as mobiles, mobs for short.  Firstly let us see if there are any mobs
around here.  Use the "{Wscan{x" command to scan the adjacent area for any life.
If the area you are scanning in is too dark to see or if a mobile or player
is hidden, you will not be able to find them.  Once you have found your
target, go to them and use the "{Wconsider <target>{x" command to see if you
stand a fair chance of defeating your foe.  "{WKill <target>{x" will initiate
combat, but if the going gets too tough "{Wflee{x" will allow you to attempt to
run away from your attacker.  Once you have used "{Wscan{x", if there is a
mobile around here, go forth and let the combat commence!

Aiel are a mysterious race and little is known about them by the other races
of the land.  Aiel culture is very complex; they live by a code of honor
known as Ji'e'toh, translated from the Old Tongue it means "honor and
obligation".  It is a way of life so complex, no "wetlander" could ever
possibly comprehend.  "Wetlander" is a term used by the Aiel and refers to
any non-Aiel person, except Ogier.  To "Wetlanders", the Aiel are a savage
race of blood thirsty warriors, Aiel have much the same regard to others not
of their race.

Codarra, Chareen, Sharaad, Miagoma and Tomanelle.  Each clan is then in turn
subdivided into smaller groups called septs.  Each clan has a chief that
governs it and the same applies to each individual sept.  Aiel clans have a
tendency to feud with each other, but some shaky alliances have been known
to form between some clans.

(Night Spears), Aethan Dor (Red Shields), Shae'en M'taal (Stone Dogs),
Sha'mad Conde (Thunder Walkers), Tain Shari (True Bloods) and Duadhe
Mahdi'in (Water Seekers).  Each society has its own purpose, rules and
regulations as well as the strict Aiel rules of conduct known as Ji'e'toh to
live by.  Far Dareis Mai is a unique society as it is the only for female
Aiel warriors.  Even if two members of the same society come from feuding
clans, they will not fight each other.

The huge marble statue at the center of the rectangular chamber depicts a

Sedai.  This particular warder is brandishing a large two-handed sword that
appears to be a part of him.  There are many rumors about Warders, some are
myths while others hold some grain of truth about them.  Warders or Gaidin
as they are also known are guards who "bonded" to an Aes Sedai using the One
Power.  Warders appear to have some benefits from bonding as they have
higher stamina and endurance, but nothing is known of what Aes Sedai have to
gain from this.

the seven ajahs~
"{CThe Seven Ajahs{x"

Aes Sedai are placed in one of seven societies usually according to their
beliefs.  All Aes Sedai are governed by the Amrylin Seat, an Aes Sedai who
is considered to be of all Ajahs but be of none (i.  E.  Maintaining a
strict code of non-favoritism over the Ajahs, although this is widely
desputed within the ranks of Aes Sedai).  The {BBlue Ajah{x, which is also known
as the {BJustice Ajah{x is a society for Aes Sedai who obviously fight for
rights and for justice.  Many Amrylins have come from this particular Ajah. 
The {RRed Ajah{x tend to oppose the Blue Ajah on most things.  Their aim is to
prevent another Breaking of the World by eliminating all male wielders of
the One Power by severing thier link with the One Power thus rendering them
unable to channel.  Unlike most of the other Ajahs, the {RRed Ajah{x never bond
with a Warder.  The {GGreen Ajah{x or the {GBattle Ajah{x has a long and proud
tradition.  They are the Aes Sedai who prepare for the Last Battle, Taimon
Gaidon.  The {GGreen Ajah{x are a unique Ajah as they can bond up to four
Warders at one time, unlike the other Ajahs who only take one Warder.  The
{GGreen Ajah{x tend to side with the Blue Ajah on White Tower internal affairs
just as the {WWhite Ajah{x tend to side with the Red Ajah.  The {WWhite Ajah{x are

River Arinelle and the northern edge of the Black Hills.  The people of
Saldaea are known for their distinctively tilted almond-shaped eyes, as well
as their military prowess, their equestrian skills being far superior to any
other Border nation.  War for Saldaean's is a family event, wives generally
joining their husbands on all military campaigns.  Most of the women are
quite skilled with knives or in hand-to-hand fighting.  Saldaean women can
be extremely sensual, the ladies of the court are known for the subtlety of
their seductions, using the language of fans to communicate their thoughts
to potential suitors.  The infamous sa'sara is a dance outlawed for its
indecency, yet most all noblewomen know how to dance it.

certainly answer the following: Peace - because he has known only war. 
Beauty - because the Blight is filled with ugliness.  And most of all, life
- because he has already sworn himself to death.  A Shienaran warrior lives
his life prepared for battle, protected by heavy clothing and armor, but
in death he is lowered unclothed into the welcoming dirt of the grave,
believing all came from the earth, and they must return as they came, naked

The floor of this room has been beautifully crafted into a huge
{Dm{wo{Wsa{wi{Dc{x, consisting of tiny brightly colored tiles arranged to
make a design depicting a map of the world.  This section of the map shows
the country of Cairhien.  The peoples of Cairhien are stern and unyielding,
they thrive on the complexities of subtle political intrigue, using the art
of misdirection and hidden meanings to gain power and status.  They have
created a dangerous and often deadly game of competition between the Houses
of Cairhien called Daes Dae'mar.  King Laman Damodred caused his own death
by playing the game when he destroyed the Aiel gift of Avendoraldera, the
only known sapling of the lost Tree of Life, and making it into a throne.

Ogier resemble humans in general build and dress, but are a genetically

Rising to a height much larger than humans, the male Ogier average ten feet
with the women standing only slightly shorter.  The life span of an Ogier is
at least three to four times of a human and are not considered truly mature
until they have reached the age of at least one hundred years old.

all of the trade in silk and ivory from Shara, yet little is known of them
except through stories and legend.  The Atha'an Miere prefer to spend most
of their lives aboard their ships and are even born upon the water.  They
wear brightly colored tattoos upon their hands, some of which denote clan,
equally brilliant sashes on their waists, gold and silver jewelry, and a
ditinct style of dress.  The Sea Folk women have an almost irresistible
allure and are told to be the epitome of beauty and temptation.  To the
Atha'an Miere, each ship is a living spirit, gifted with a man's heart and
courage.  These ships are as much a part of the Sea Folk family as any
human.

said to be able to twist a man around their wrist with a look, and imprison
his heart with a single smile.  The clothes they wear are considered
scandalous by most other standards, their dresses covering their bodies from
neck to toes, but are barely opaque and cling to every curve.  Most Domani

To use the changer simply give him the silver or gold you wish to have

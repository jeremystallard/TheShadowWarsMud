Assembly Road is a wide road paved with dull gray stone and bordered by
snowy white buildings.  Nearly all of these buildings have white plaster
coating their external walls but the grander and more ornate structures have
been constructed from pure white stone.  Two of Tanchico's most famous
landmarks are situated near this point, to the southwest is the Grand Hall
of the Assembly and in the far distance to the south is the Great Circle.

This is the north lobby inside the Great Circle, one of Tanchico's three
great stadiums.  Although it is the smallest of the stadiums, the grand
white stone structure towers over every other building on the Calapene
Peninsula.  A wide gallery follows the entire inner circumference of the
building with tall yet narrow arched windows looking out over the arena
floor.  Ornate reliefs of great ships and harbor scenes have been carved
into the outer wall of the gallery.  Finally there is a barred gateway built
into the inner wall which is all that stands in the way of accessing the
arena floor.

The arena floor is a huge circular area of hard-packed dirt that is
enclosed within the white stone structure of the Great Circle.  The inner
wall is approximately fifteen feet in height and has elaborate friezes of
horse races and other grand events that are held within the colossal
building.  Behind the inner wall are the spectators' seats that form
concentric circles around the arena, rising like steps of white stone.  Four
arched gateways built into the inner wall appear to be the only routes in or
out of the arena floor.

At this spot Calapene Road connects Assembly Road, Calapene Peninsula's
main thoroughfare.  Both roads have been built using large slabs of stone
that are gray.  Contrasting against the dullness of the road are the white
plaster covered buildings that flank it.  Many of the buildings within this
district are shops and inns but there are also some houses in the area too.

This section of Assembly Road cuts through the center of the Calapene
Peninsula.  Other narrower streets lead off from this main road past grand
tearooms, fancy restaurants, and exclusive inns that are often frequented by
Taraboner nobility who hide beneath masks.  This area of Tanchico is not
solely the playground of the rich, merchants and traders travel through this
area to reach the Calapene Docks that lie somewhere west of this point.

Assembly Road is a wide thoroughfare paved with dull gray stone that
leads through the center of the Calapene Peninsula.  Other narrower streets
lead off from here past grand tearooms, posh restaurants, and exclusive inns
that are often visited by Taraboner nobility who hide beneath flamboyant
masks.  This district of Tanchico is not solely the playground of the rich,
merchants and traders travel through this area to reach the Calapene Docks. 
Another of the city's famous landmarks lies on the east side of Assembly
Road, the restaurant known as the Garden of the Silver Breezes.

Tall white buildings flank Assembly Road, Calapene Peninsula's main
thoroughfare.  Rather than being made of white stone, these buildings have
their exterior walls covered in a layer of white plaster.  Chips and holes
in the plaster reveal these buildings to be constructed from brown bricks. 
There are a lot of shops and houses in this district although the houses are
clearly distinguished from the shops because they lack any windows facing
onto the streets.

{yThe G{Yran{yd H{Yal{yl of the A{Yssembl{yy{x - {wThe Main Gate{x~
A wide road paved with white stone slabs leads up the side of a steep
grassy hill.  At the crest of the hill is a grand hall constructed from pure
white stone and topped with a single yet vast golden dome.  At the bottom of
the road is a pair of ornate iron gates that appear to be the only route
beyond a tall white stone wall that has been built around the base of the
hill.

{yThe G{Yran{yd H{Yal{yl of the A{Yssembl{yy{x - {wA Large Courtyard{x~
This is a large square courtyard that sprawls out before a domed building
crowned known as the Hall of the Assembly.  Like the hall that towers over
it, this courtyard has been constructed from slabs of glistening white
stone.  Tall fluted columns made of white marble border the courtyard, and
in turn the columns are bordered by flowering rosebushes.  Three roads lead
off from the courtyard but the one of most interest is the wide one that
leads down the side of the hill towards the main gateway.

impressive as the view of the arena floor from this point.  The entire
building has been constructed from white marble-like stone that delicately
shimmers in the sunlight or the torches that light the area at night.  There
are many tiers of benches carved from white stone that encircle almost the
whole arena; the rows of benches are split up by sloping walkways that are
perpendicular to them.

With its gilded lamps and ceilings inlaid with brass fretwork, its
serving women and men chosen for grace and beauty and discretion, the Garden
of the Silver Breezes has always been the most expensive wine shop in the
city.  It is also one of the most notorious gathering places for the rich
and powerful who conceal their identities behind flamboyant masks within its
walls.  This is merely the entrance hall for at the center of the chamber is
a spiraling staircase made of wood, enclosed by a wooden balustrade.  There
are two doorways leading off from this chamber but neither of them is marked
with any signs to say where they lead to.

This tavern is probably one of the roughest establishments in the

by oil lanterns that hang from the ceiling.  The walls have been left bare,
revealing the mixture of bricks, stone and timber that were used in the
tavern's construction.  A thin layer of wood shavings adorns the floorboards
but they fail to succeed in hiding the blood stains from past barroom
brawls.  At one end of the room is a bar while at the opposite side of the
room is a wooden stage used by the tavern's entertainers.

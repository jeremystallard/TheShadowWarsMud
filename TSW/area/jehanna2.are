You are in a guard room within the palace dungeon.  A long table is in 
the middle of the room with chairs around it.  Whips in different sizes, 
lengths and thickness', with a number of different tails, pincers and tongs, and
clamps, and irons line the wall.  Things that look like metal boots, and gauntlets,
and helmets with great screws all over them as if to tighten them down are in racks
along another wall.  Other various instruments that you can only guess the use of
 rest along yet another wall.  There is an inner door to the south that leads to
the cells.  A set of stairs lead up into the darkness.

In a Cell~
You are in a cell deep within the Jheda Palace. The floor is bare, and cold,
and hard.  The door of rough planks, is splintered as if countless futile
fingers have clawed at it.  It is the only break in the gray stone walls.
A single rush torch provides the only light.  Messages are scratched into
the walls like:
"The light have mercy on my soul and let me die".
The only exit is the door to the west.

In a Cell~
You are in a cell deep within the Jheda Palace. The floor is bare, and
cold, and hard.  The door of rough planks, is splintered as if
countless futile fingers have clawed at it.  It is the only break in
the gray stone walls.  A single rush torch provides the only light.
Messages are scratched into the walls like:
       "The light have mercy on my soul and let me die".  
The only exit is the door to the north.

In the Bowels of the Castle~
There is no worked plaster of fine tapestries here.  Only bare stone and 
plain wood. Light in the halls comes from rush torches, smoking the 
ceiling and spread far enough apart that the light fades between them.  
Stairs lead up to the main floor of the palace.  A narrow hallway leads north.

You are in the kitchen of the Jheda Palace.  The room is huge.  Roasts 
turn on spits.  Cooks are everywhere.  Stringing pots, slicing bread,
cutting vegetables. Girls run in and out with plates and bowls carrying
the food to the queen and her guests above.  A large counter of polished
bone white lines one end of the room.

On the Lugard Road~
The road is hard packed dirt, lined by tress on either side.  It runs 
through low hills; cuts right through them sometimes if the hills are wide
enough to make the road go much out of its way and not so big that the
digging through was to difficult.  The road appears to be straight to the
eye, but it is apparent by the angle of the sun that it curves slowly
southward as it heads east. To the west is the gate of a city.  The road
continues to the east.  Untamed forest is to the north and south.

two long wooden doors that stand open on a yard for shoeing horses and
oxen, complete with an ox sling.  Hammers rest in their stands, tongs of 
various kinds and sizes hang on the exposed wall joists, buttresses and 
hoof knives and other farrier's tools lay neatly arranged on wooden 
benches with chisels and beak irons and swages and all the implements of 
the blacksmith craft.  Bins hold various lengths of iron and steel in 
various thickness'.  Five grinding wheels of different roughness stand 
about the hard dirt floor, along with six anvils, and three stone-sided 
forges with their bellows, only one currently holds coals.

road runs west from here and the soaring spires of the Jheda Palace
can be seen in the distance to the north.  South lies the Amador Road

of hundreds of shops working, thousands of people talking.  People
fill the streets.  Sedan chairs are everywhere, polemen pushing along
with never a care for the people they push aside.  Occasionally a
carriage, all vivid paint and gilt squeeze through the throng behind
a four or six horse team.  There is an inn to the south, and the road
leads east towards the Lugard Gate and west into a large square.

The room is large and paneled with dark wood,  and fires on two
hearths warm the room.  A serving maid stands here sweeping the floor,
despite the fact that it is already clean, another is polishing the 
candle sticks in the corner.  They both look up and smile at you as you
walk in. Only a few of the dozen tables have people at them, and while none
look excited to see you at least they look clean and sober.  The smells of 
baking bread and roasting beef drift from the kitchen.  The kitchen is to
the north. There is a library to the west.  Stairs lead to the rooms above.

Library~
The shelves must hold three or four hundred books.  Clothbound, or
leather with gilded spines.  Only a few have wooden covers.  There are
titles such as 'The travels of Jain Farstrider',  'The Essays of Willim 
of Maneches' and 'Voyages Among the Sea Folk'.  A small fire place is
in the corner and two chairs and a stones board are in front of it. Large
leather bound chairs fill the room.  In short it is the perfect place to 
curl up and read.  The common room is to the south.

The Lugard Road~
You stand on a wide boulevard split down the middle by broad
strips of grass and trees.   A hum lies on the city, the steady drone
of hundreds of shops working, thousands of people talking.  People
fill the streets.  Sedan chairs are everywhere, polemen pushing along
with never a care for the people they push aside.  Occasionally a 
carriage, all vivid paint and gilt squeeze through the throng behind a
four or six horse team. To the south you see a tavern , the road leads
east towards the Lugard Gate and west into the city.

A Gleeman plays his lute in another part of the pub, and a few people

to see that the needs of his customers are met.  The bar is to your

A Room in the Pub~
This part of the pub is filled with dancing and singing.  A wandering
minstrel is on a chair in a corner with his lute.  A busty red headed
woman is standing near him and singing a tale of comedic heroism. Drunk
men sit laughing at their tables and busy bar maids weave through the
crowd with full mugs and horns of ale and mead.  Another part of the pub
is located to your west. The bar is to the south.

The kitchen is neat, and small, with copper pots hanging on the wall,
and dried herbs and sausages from the ceiling.  Several tall cupboards
of pale wood have doors carved with some sort of tall grass.  The
table is scrubbed almost bone white, and the backs of the chairs have
flowers carved into them.  Dishes line the mantel, and more a neatly
stacked on shelves to either side.  The floor looks clean enough to
eat off.  There is a small yard to the west.

Seamstress Shop~
The interior of the shop is not large and every scrap of the wall is 
taken up by shelves holding bolts of silk or finely woven wool, spools
of piping and binding, and ribbon, and lace of every width and description.
Dressmaker's dummies stand about the floor wearing garments ranging from
half-made to  complete, from something suitable for a dance in embroidered
green wool to a pearly silk gown that could have done very well at a court.
At first glance the shop has the look of prosperity and activity, but you 
can see dust on many of the dresses.  The only exit is to the west.

distance below you.   The Jheda place can be seen in the distance to the 
west, and the Mountains of Mist still further to the west.  The tall
buildings below you stand crowded together, blocky structures  with
scabrous once white plaster gone in huge places revealing the red brick
below.  The sun does not reach into the shadows of the buildings.  The
road heads down nearly a hundred paces or continues to the south.

Dingy laundry hangs from every third window in the buildings that are
actually occupied.  A sour sweet smell of decay permeates the air, from
last months chamber pots and garbage that lays wherever it was flung. 
The entire area is in the flood plane of the Boern river.  This is
definitely not one of the nicer parts of the city.  The Boern Road

despite the fact that the floor is filthy, another is sleeping in the 
corner. Neither look up as you walk in. Only a few of the dozen tables have 
people at them, most are drunk and dirty.  The smells of burnt fish and
stale beer drift from the kitchen.  The kitchen is to the north.  There
is a library to the west.  Stairs lead to the rooms above.

The Lumber Mill~
You are in a lumber mill.  Wood is the primary export of Ghealdan and this
is the processing center for it before it is sent down river or over land.
A large water wheel turns the blade that cuts the wood.  Stacks upon stacks
of wood are here waiting to be transported to the docks to be shipped
around the world.

Men walk to and fro counting crates and writing down their findings. This

from areas outside the city. These goods are then delivered to the various
stores. The export area of the warehouses is to the south.

You stand on a long stone quay that runs for about half the length of the
city.  Gray docks stretch out into the river with ships of all kinds 
attached to them.  They rock with the wind and rub against the docks
despite the bags stuffed with wool hung down between for fenders.  
The stone Quay continues to the east.  Docks stretch out into the river
to the south. North are the warehouses that receive the goods shipped by
the river.  A waterfall blocks all travel to the west.

plain wood. Light in the halls comes from rush torches, smoking the 
ceiling and spread far enough apart that the light faded between them.

are everywhere.  Thick with leaves or fruit.  Lush vines cover arbors over
the path.  Flowers and bushes spray the garden with color from purest white
to deep, deep red.  A large hill rises here above the rest of the park.

The large hill gives a spectacular view of the city of Jehannah.  The
Blue and White banner of Ghealdan can be seen flying proudly on the
towers of the palace.  The city seems to master its hills instead of
flowing over them.  From here it looks harsh and shadowed.  The Boern
River can be see in the distance to the north.  The Mountains of Mist
are to the west.  The path leads east down the hill and into a grove
of tress, the tops of which almost reach the hill, or west into a garden.

In the Grove~
The Great Trees tower above you.  Their spreading tops a hundred spans
and more in the air.  Oaks and Elms, Leather Leafs and firs are dwarfed
beneath them.  A wall of sorts encompasses the grove, an endless series
of spiraling stone arches five spans high and twice as wide.  The Grove
has neither the tame look of a park nor the complete haphazardness of
the forest depths.  Rather, it seems to be the ideal of nature; the perfect
woods the most beautiful it could be. What seems like a wall of stone is
deep in the Grove to the west.

Square Chamber~
You are in a square chamber about the size of the common room of an inn. 
Its walls present hunting scenes carved in relief in stone of the purest
white.  The tapestries between the carvings are gentle images of bright
flowers and brilliantly plumaged hummingbirds except for two at the far
end of the room where the Blue and White banner of Ghealdan stand taller
than a man.  These two hang flanking a dais, and on the dais is a gilded
throne.

You stomp your way through the underbrush.  The forest gets pretty thick
here, and the branches high above your head are so thick that they block out
all direct sunlight.  While it is much too thick to go further south or
east, you might be able to make your way though the forest to the north. 
There is a road to the west.

you cannot make out what it is from here. There is a small road to the

wheat,  or beans.  This is how the city of Jehannah feeds itself.  To

The Foothills of the Mountains of Mist~
The hills are low, but the way is all up and down, with never a flat
stretch.  Huge pines block out the sun and make the going dark and
dangerous.  Undergrowth threatens to trip you, and branches lash out
against your face and chest.  For every foot you travel forward you
travel two feet up or down.  The hills continue to the north, south

to steep to climb.  The hills continue to the north, south and east.

The Foothills of the Mountains of Mist~
The hills are low, but the way is all up and down, with never a flat
stretch.  Huge pines block out the sun and make the going dark and
dangerous.  Undergrowth threatens to trip you, and branches lash out against
your face and chest.  For every foot you t ravel forward you travel two feet
up or down.  The hills continue to the north and west.  The forest to the
south and east is to thick to enter.

Outskirts of the Great Blackwood~
The trees of Forest of Shadows are lush and green, hiding the evil that
lurks in these woods.  The trees become too thick to the east, but you may
go north.  A bridge leading over the Boern River and into the city of
Jehannah is to the south.  There is a sign here.

In the Forest of Shadows~
You stomp your way through the underbrush.  The forest gets pretty thick
here, and the branches high above your head are so thick that they block out
all direct sunlight.  While it is much too thick to go east, you might be
able to make your way though the forest to the north, west or south.

In the Forest of Shadows~
All the things that grow in dark places grow here, all the things with
spores all the things that love the dank.  Fungus rings the trees in
the deep shadows of the forest.  Lichens dig their roots in, nettles
and Deathshead mushrooms dot the landscape.  Every leaf and creeper
seems bloated; ready to burst with touch.  Flowers hang on trees
and weeds mocking you with their beauty.  The sweet stench of decay
fills the air making it taste like rotten meat.  The forest continues
in every direction.

Before A Waygate~
You stand in a grove, with Great Trees towering above you.  What seems like
a carved wall lays to the west, down a small decline.  Surrounded by trees
and brush, you realize this is no wall.
     {gYou suddenly stand before a huge slab of stone, like a wall, carved
thickly with leaves and vines. No human could have made something so
lifelike, this must be the work of a Ogier. How a {DW{Waygat{De{g could be
forgotten is unknown to you, but time can play a large factor over many
things. After further examination, you can see the precious {Gtrefoil
leaf of Avendesora{g required to make all {DW{Waygate{Ds{g work. The leaves
on the Waygate could ripple with the next breeze.{w

A Large Garden with Statues~
A massive area of greenery and foilage has been built here to commemorate
someone from the age of legends, or perhaps an entire army.  The garden is
filled with blooming flowers, mostly pinks and reds, but there are also a
few yellow flowers too that seem to attract small, yellow finches.  The
statues are large and made of marble.  Their clothing is old, making you
thing that they are legendary warriors.  They are very strong and almost
fearful looking.

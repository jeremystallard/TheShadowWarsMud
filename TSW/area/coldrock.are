A lone {yh{Ya{ywk{x soars gracefully through the {cs{Ck{cy{x.
~
This desert raptor is a bird of prey. It has a strong, hooked beak,
Its claws have three toes pointed forward and one turned back; and
its talons are long, curved, and very sharp. It flies in slow, 
measured wing beats, and turns while soaring overhead. The broad
rounded tail shows a rich {rr{Ru{rss{Re{rt{R-{rr{Re{rd{w. The wing span is just over five feet long.

A mother {Gg{gara {Gl{gizard{x ruthlessly protects her nest.
~
This particular {Gg{gara{G l{gizard{w is slightly larger than average,
with a large round body of about 4 feet long, and a tail equally long.
It is colored {ybrown{w around the head which diffuses into a {rre{yd{rdi{ys{rh{w
{ybr{row{yn{w netlike pattern. It has {Ytan{w and g{Wra{wy spots on the neck and
trunk. It has a slightly {Mpinkish{x hue on it's belly, evidence of recently
mating. The diurnal lizard will normally climb into bushes and rocks
seeking cooler areas in extreme heat, but it can remain active in even the
hottest sunlight.

A {DM{wa{Wid{we{Dn{x of the {DS{wp{We{wa{Dr{x sits here, balanced on her feet.
~
She is tall for a woman, standing roughly 5 foot 10 inches, with
short {Rred{w hair and {Gg{green{w eyes. This guard is a {DS{wc{Wo{wu{Dt{w
of {DS{wp{Wea{wr{Ds{w, being charged with the rather high-honor task
of being the first line of defense for Cold Rocks Hold. From the way
she carries her two short-spears, you have a feeling she not only
knows how to use them, but does so quite often.

An {yA{Yi{We{yl{x b{Wut{xc{Wh{xer prepares {yhides{x and {rmeats{x.
~
Not every Aiel is a member of a Warrior Society. There are those 
whose lives are dedicated to the feeding, care, and preservation
of the people as well. These are the oft-sung heroes of the Aiel.
 
The butcher is slim, and looks like he may have been a fighter at
one time, but has grown older in the years and has settled down
to a life of preparing meats and hides for the Tardaad Clan.

A herd of c{yat{wt{yl{we grazes quietly in the shade.
~
These are short, squat, hairy beasts bred for their quality and 
abundance of meat, rather than their aesthetic pleasure. They
look something like cows, though shorter by a good two feet. 
The males in the bunch have large ram-shaped horns. They are
also a good deal shaggier. Come to think of it, they don't much
look like cows at all. But it's a good comparison.

blood snake bloodsnake~
a {rb{Rlo{rod{Rs{rna{Rk{re{w~
A long {Rr{re{Rd{x snake slithers through the {gg{Gra{gss{Ge{gs{x.
~
The bloodsnake is typically 2 to 4 feet long and very poisonous.
Its scales are a diamond-pattern of {rc{Rr{Ri{rm{Rso{rn{x and {Dblack{x. Known
for being one of the primary predators in the desert, the bloodsnake is
so called not for its colour, but the properties of its {mp{Moi{ms{Mo{mn{x.
After a successful bite, the venom prevents the blood from clotting.
While the venom itself does no actual poison damage, many targets end
up bleeding to death along their escape, leaving an easy trail
for both the snake and anything else to follow.

The desert coyote is thin and looks like it hasn't eaten in a while.
Gentle eyes regard you curiously and it yawns, exposing sharp teeth
to belie its harmless appearance. This is no common housedog. This
here be a genuine hungry predator that might eat you as soon as
look at you.

Shae'en M'taal Surac of the Nine Valleys Sept~
A {DS{wt{Wo{wn{De D{wo{Dg{x guards the entrance to the {Cw{cell{x.
~
This Aiel guard is easily one of the largest you've ever seen. His {Yhair{w
is closely cropped, outlining a scar-covered face that does not look 
particularly bright. Nor does it have to be. He stands easily  seven
feet tall, with {cd{Bee{cp b{Clu{ce{x eyes that show determination and pride
in his duty to guard the well. It's  obvious that if you want to get
to the well, you will have to pass him first.

In his hands rests a massive double-bladed spear, and on his belt, the
key to the door.

you get too close, he holds a {ytan{x hand out, ordering you to stop.

when he would go to the practice yards after schooling.  He politely nods at
all he passes and winks a light {gg{Gre{We{gn{x eye at all the pretty girls.

raid on the hold's {yc{Dat{yt{Dle{x.  All Aiel warrior's realize that they must be
ready for such events.  This man must be one of the society leaders to hold
this drill.  His {ytan{x, stern face shows that he has the age to have earned
this position.

This young lady was obviously taken as gai'shain some time ago.  Most
likely she was a Far Dareis Mai, though it is considered rude to speak about
a gai'shains life before they donned the {Wwhite{w-{Wrobe{w, so you might never
know.  This particular one waits patiently in the shadows in the corner,
making an art of not being seen or heard unless she is needed.  In one hand
she carries a small bucket of water, and in the other she holds a ladel.

He is dressed in fine {Ygolden{w silks and looks to be a young
adult. Shrewd eyes regard you curiously and constantly shift, as
if expecting at any moment to have to defend his wares from
intruders.

This Aiel woman looks rather dignified and proud. Perhaps middle aged,
she has the look of one who has seen enough in her years to be rather
unimpressed by you. She wears a {Wcr{wea{Wm{w-coloured blouse and sensible
{ybrown{w skirts down past her knees. On her hands are rings of deep
{gg{Gree{gn e{Gme{gr{Gal{gds{w, as well as her neck. Both match her intense

just beginning to show the occasional streak of silver that comes
with age.

This Aiel woman appears to be of some great degree of import.
The other Aiel give her a wide berth, and despite the fact she
carries no spear, you get the impression that the warriors would
rather not tangle with her. 
 
Despite her scowl, however, there is a gentle kindness in her
{Cpale blue{w eyes that is hard to cover up. On one hand she wears
a glove that appears to be made of rings made from some {Rred crystal{w
substance, linked together by one chain.

oblong, rounded at the ends, finely wrinkled by a strongly-marked network of
veins on both sides, {ggr{weyi{gs{wh-{gg{Gr{geen{w in colour, softly hairy, and beneath

The various herbal uses of sage are many.
It is reputed to mitigate grief in the mind and body, cure certain types of 
snakebite, increases the inebriating quality of liquor, helps sore gums, and
makes a good snuff. Sage is also quite nutricious as well.

sausage~
MMMmmmmmMMMmm!!! You can almost taste it just by looking at it. 
Blood sausages are made standard with 3 1/2 quarts of blood,
3 1/2 lbs leaf lard, 2 lbs chestnuts, 3 1/2 cups cream, 2 lbs
of onions, 2 tblspn salt, ground black pepper to taste and the
large intestine of a pig.
 
Have ready a large pot of simmering water and a basket or strainer
to pull out the sausages when they are boiled. Prepare chestnuts;
they should be boiled until tender (about 20 minutes) and skinned,
then roughly chopped. Gently fry the onions in some of the lard
until very tender and creamy. Add the lard, and remove from the heat.
To the melted lard and onions, add the cream, spices, and chestnuts.
Mix the salt in with the blood, then beat it into the cooling mix.
 
Tie a knot in one end of a length of intestine, and use a funnel to
pour the thick liquid in. Make coils of sausage on the table, and
twist the coils to make individual sausages. Do not overfill or 
they will burst in cooking and become inedible.
 
Lower the coils of sausages gently into the barely simmering water,
and allow to heat for about 15 to 20 minutes or until just firm. Do
not allow to boil. If they float to the surfave, prick them with a
needle. Keep testing for doneness by pricking with a needle. When 
they no longer "bleed" liquid and are barely firm, they are done and
should be carefully removed from the pot and placed into cold water
for a few minutes to cool. To preserve them, brush them with melted
lard to form a glaze.

bloodsnake~
A tasty dish despite the name, there are various ways to prepare it...
Get a bloodsnake large enough to make 6 fillets, taking care to remove
the bone. Winter bamboo as well as Gan bamboo will be needed as well.
 
Cut the snake into fillets, and the winter bamboo into slices. Cut the
Gan bamboo into flower shapes. Steep the snake fillets in salt and
soy sauce and flour for about 20 minutes, then stir fry in four-fold
hot oil. Stir-fry finely chopped garlic, drop in the Gan bamboo shoots,
then snake slices, bamboo slices, and a cooking sherry. Add salt, soy,
sesame oil, and pepper to taste, and stir-fry until finished.

meat~
Goat meat is used in a variety of recipes including the famous
Goat Meatball Curry! You will need a pound of goat meat, 1 tsp
haldi (turmeric), 2 tsp mirchi powder (red chili pepper), 1 tsp
ginger paste, 1 tsp garlic past, 1 large diced onion, oil, and 
salt to taste.
 
Let's not forget the ingredients for the Masala! 2 tblsp Dry
Coconut, 1 tsp poppy seeds, 1 tsp sesame seeds, 1/2 tsp cumin seed
8-10 lavang clove, 4-5 Elaichi (Cardamom), and 2 tblsp of cashew
nuts.
 
Wash minced meat and keep aside till water is drained out. Take
a pan and fry all the Masala ingredients seperately and then 
grind them. Take 1/3rd each of the masala, haldi, mirchi powder 
and the ginger and garlic pastes. Mix well with the minced meat
and add salt to taste. Form small firm balls from the goat meat.
In a vessel, heat oil. Add diced onion and fry till brown. Add the
remaining 2/3rds of the ginger and garlic pastes, haldi, mirchi 
powder, and the masala and fry till oil oozes out. Add a little
water, when it starts to simmer add meatballs and cook for 5-10
minutes on a high fire. Then resume cooking on a low fire for
5 more minutes. Garnish with coriander leaves.

A Glint of Light in the Distance~
The {ys{Yu{yn{w beats down upon you mercilessly.  The oppressive heat rolls off
the sand in relentless waves.  The parched ground, strewn with cracks for
miles in every direction ripples on the horizon, a trick of the light and
heat.  The slightest glint of light in the distance catches your eye to the
southeast.  
~

C 15

~
Aha! There it is again... perhaps if you were to get a bit closer you
could see it better. The ripples of heat are distorting the light rather
severely, but you're fairly certain it's to the southwest.
~
E
glint~
Yes, you definitly saw a glint of l{Wi{Yg{Wh{wt in the distance.  Perhaps if you
travelled closer to the southeast you could make more out, but the boiling
{Rh{Ye{Rat{w has distorted and spread out the light too much to discern any
noticeable details about it.  
~
E
heat~
The heat is incredible...  Rolling off the ground in waves, it bends
light, warps the vision and the mind, and come to think of it, pretty much
anything you left out here for too long...  Including yourself.  
~
E
light~
The light appears to be w{Whi{wte, though it is difficult to tell because
of the washed-out colors that distance and heat causes. As you stare in
the direction where you last saw it, you see the g{Wl{Yi{Wn{wt once more...

The cracks in the parched landscape gradually grow smaller. The occasional 
{yrock{w dots the otherwise monotonous landscape. Again, you see the l{Wi{Yg{Wh{wt

mirage. To the northwest, the {rA{Rie{Wl Wa{Rst{re{w stretches onwards...

waste~
{DTh{re {RAi{We{Rl W{ras{Dte{x

{W=============={x

The Aiel Waste is not known for its hospitality.  Long ago the 13 tribes
fled east of the Dragonwall and made their homes in this desolate wasteland.
As unforgiving as a blacksmith's forge, they were hardened into a culture of
honor and survival.  Water, so rare, so precious, is the main unifying force
between many of the Septs, Tribes, and Warrior Societies.  Water...  The
cause and solution to most of life's problems in the Wastes is extremely
hard to find and thusly, when a steady stream is found, a hold will spring
up around it, viciously guarded from any intruders.  If you can only find a
Hold...  Perhaps there you may find shade and water.

Hills on the Horizon~
On the southeast horizon you begin to see the dark outline of a

catch the g{Wl{Yi{Wn{wt of l{Yi{wg{Yh{wt near the top of it.  Small {gs{yc{Yru{yb{gs{w dot the landscape

scrubs~
Small {yde{Ys{we{Yr{yt{w bushes, such as the Yucca and Staghorn  dot

someone... or something.

light~
The light appears to be reflecting off of something.
Perhaps it is a shiny bit of metal, or perhaps some exposed
quartz. From here, though, it is impossible to tell from just
the g{Wl{Yi{Wn{wt.

glint~
The l{Wi{Yg{Wh{wt appears to be moving with some sort of pattern.
Most likely it is some sort of s{Yi{wgn{Ya{wl beacon, though it
is still difficult to tell from this far away. Somehow, though,
you have the feeling that any inhabitants in the area already
know that you are here.

fact that it looks large and purplish through the distance and rippling heat

At the Borders of an Aiel Hold~
On a flat-surfaced rock appears to be a marker of sorts; a red {rs{Rh{Wie{Rl{rd{w
with two {ys{Yp{Wea{Yr{ys{w crossed behind it. This is definitly a border marker of
some sort. It would be a really good idea to walk out in open now and
announce your presence in a very loud manner, lest they think you are
attempting a sneak attack.
 
Other than the obvious, of course, it appears that the desert is finally
giving way to hills made of {Dbl{wa{Dck gr{wa{Dn{wi{Dte{w and beyond them, the cliffs.

wide with serated edges.  They look quite lethal.

granite~
The black granite is one of those amazing little things nature throws
out of the woodwork every so often. Smooth and cool to the touch, granite
is known for it's ability to withstand the hottest heat, and the toughest
picks and chisels. It takes an expert craftsman to be able to make anything
more serviceable than a doorstop out of the stuff, but it is quite 
beautiful and thus highly sought after by many west of the Dragonwall.
 
In this particular circumstance, another thought comes to mind... a natural
fortress made of granite would be extremely difficult to penetrate.

outside {CC{col{Cd {CR{cock{Cs H{col{Cd{w.  Here, if you are polite you may find shade and
water.  If you offend, then you will find death.  The choice is yours.  
 
To the north appears to be a small {Gg{gra{Gz{gin{Gg{w area. From there you can hear
the taletell sounds of goats and cattle. To the south appears to be
a trail towards an area with slightly more vegetation. To the west
is the loneliness of the Waste.

A Secluded Grazing Area~
This is a simple grazing area used to feed the g{Woa{wts and {Dc{ya{Dtt{yl{De{w of the
hold.  A valley, it stands between the high natural wall of granite to the
left and the walls of the hold to the east.  S{Yag{weg{Yra{wss grows here in healthy
abundance, along with some various edible scrubs.  You are watched carefully
as you move about the cattle.  Aiel do not appreciate thieves, and deal with
them harshly.

A herd of goats grazes here peacefully oblivious to pretty much

cattle~
The cattle are shaggy squat hairy beasts with wide hooves and 
thick coats. They have the look of being hearty and stable in
the desert climate, while providing the most meat, bone, leather
and fur, while only needing a minimal amount of food and water.
These beasts are obviously bred well to the task.
~
E
sagegrass~
A good herb, sage. It feeds cattle, and when burned provides a 
pleasant aroma that repels evil spirits. The medicinal properties
of sagegrass are many. Hmmm... perhaps maybe if you took some,
no one would notice?

The flap moves away to reveal a butchery. An older Aiel stands here,
carving up various meats from the slaughterhouse for trade and sale.
The scent of {rb{Rlo{rod {wmixed with sweat is strong in this room. From

hides for tanning. Behind the butchers table you see a leather {yhide{w

blood~
You notice, however, the place is actually quite clean. The blood

A Small Well-Used Trail~
A small hunting trail leads along the side of the Hold into the hills. 
All around you grow various scrub and ca{gct{wi, each competing for the spare
amounts of water in the area.  The granite rocks that tower around you
provide a small amount of shade from the {ys{Yu{yn{w in this blasted land.  The
trail continues southward into a hunting grounds, or north back to {CC{cold

sun~
There is finally a bit of shelter against the sun when you stand

you reach forward, out of the shade into sunlight, it is almost
tangible, like pressing against a searing film.

E
scrub~
Sage, yucca, and various desert grasses provide homes for all
sorts of desert creatures like mice and snakes.

E
cacti~
The cacti are able to survive the merciless desert climate because of
their unique features for storing water and collecting it.  The most common
features are a waxy coating that prevents water from escaping through the
trunk, and needles to collect water from the air and protect the cactus from
animals that might nibble on it and break the waxy coating.  Those who know
their way around a desert will never be short on water or food when cactus
is near.

life~
There are many indigenous life forms in the desert that actually manage

Off the Beaten Path~
Heading west of the trail, the game appears to be a bit better here.  The
lush desert vegetation provides a good environment to find edible plants and
animals.  Though it is also a good place to be considered edible by certain
plants and animals as well.  To the southwest you can see what looks to be a
small cluster of granite slabs.

predator.

You're a bit further out in the wilderness now, the {Dc{wl{Dif{wfs are beginning
to appear to be more {mpu{Mr{mpl{Mis{mh{w than black.  Lush desert vegetation grows
about you, creating a rather peaceful and serene setting.  To the southwest
you can see a cluster of {Dgr{wa{Dni{wt{De{w slabs providing what might be a good
camping area.

granite~
Those granite slabs you see to the southwest appear to be two large slabs
about twenty feet tall leaning against each other in a natural formation. 
Beneath which you may find shade from the elements.  Especially the sun.  
~
E
cliffs~
The cliffs on the horizon are made of the same black granite that the
rest of the rock in this area is made of.  With that large of an area of
shade --and possibly water-- there is little doubt of civilization being in
that area.

A Thinned-Out Hunting Trail~
The hunting trail is thinned out, and disappears in spots.  It is getting
harder to follow it accurately, though the cliffs in the distance are a
pretty good indication of where you are.  Around you, desert life flourishes
in the shade of the hills, a tantalizing promise of water in the area.

Further Out In the Wilderness~
The lush desert vegetation provides food and shelter for all manner of
desert creatures around you.  Hardened by the sun and rigorous struggle for
daily survival, it is likely these plants and animals will likely be here
till the end of time.  To the west is evidence of a hunting trail, to the
north, east, and south the wilderness continues outwards.

Near a Natural Shelter~
There is just a hint of cliffs to the north.  Only the ridge pokes out in
hazy {mpu{Mr{mp{Ml{me{w far above the horizon, distorted by the rippling heat waves. 
Around you are the natural s{Wc{wr{Wub{ws of the {yd{Yes{ye{Yr{yt{w that provide food and
shelter for the various animals.  Immediately to your west is a natural
shelter made of g{Dra{wn{Di{wt{De{w, providing shade from the blasting heat of the
{ys{Yu{yn{w.

Faint Signs of a Hunting Trail~
There are faint s{Wi{wg{Wn{ws of a hunting trail in this area.  You get the
feeling that these parts are not travelled frequently by any but the animals
that live in the area.  The {ys{Yu{yn {wbeats down upon you mercilessly, trying to
claim every drop of water you have in your meager little body.  In a contest
of wills, Mother Nature would win in this area.

see the {mp{Mur{mpl{Mi{msh {wcrest of a cliff face over the horizon.

Inside a Natural Granite Shelter~
Within the confines of this natural cave you find it to be surprisingly
{ccool{x.  The temperature must be at least twenty degrees lower in here than
outside in the {ys{Yu{yn{w, giving you a chance to actually relax a bit and think. 
This would be an excellent place for a {gca{ym{Yp{ysi{gte{w, and in fact, a few
scattered ashes are evidence that such has been the use for this place many
times in the past.

The massive {Dgr{xa{Dni{xt{De{x archway seems to stretch on forever...The sheer
simplicity mixed with the thirty foot height, and smooth grandeur of the
g{Wo{Yld{We{xn-veined black rock is enough to take your breath away, especially as
the sun hits the rock, making it glow in bright veins, while the black rock
itself absorbs the light, creating a surreal duality about you.

granite~

veins~
It appears that there are gold intrusions in the granite. 
Such things generally occur when the granite is already formed,
and molten rock or metal seeps upwards into the cracks... as
it cools it expands, forcing much back out of the rock. What
remains inside is what adds to part of the beauty of granite.
~
E
archway~
It is easy to see why kings and queens pay a hefty ransom for
this sort of stone. Surely the smoothly polished slabs of
{Dgr{wa{Dni{wt{We{w were not intended to be anything but functional,
but you have the distinct impression that they are not 
displeased with the results. The arch extends for perhaps
thirty feet upwards, and fifty feet inward. The top is square
and, if you are any judge, perfectly level as well.

Wandering Through the Warrens~
The {Dw{war{Wrr{wen{Ds{w twist and turn in various tunnels.  No one else appears
lost, but it is a bit confusing, since there is very little decoration, and
the s{Yag{we{Wo{Yi{wl l{Yam{wps really only provide enough light to avoid breaking your
neck.  Where there are not more {Dw{war{Wrr{wen{Ds{w, there are flaps of {rpa{yi{rnt{ye{rd

A Medium-Sized Dwelling~
You have entered the dwelling of a {rT{Raa{Wr{Rda{rd A{Ri{We{rl{w, average size for a
married couple.  The furniture is fairly spartan, as {ywood{w is so rare, and
few Aiel use chairs anyway.  The walls are decorated with simple leather
w{Wal{wlsc{Wro{wlls, painted with curious designs.  The floor is littered with
several c{Mus{wh{Mi{wo{Mn{ws.

The Shop of a Trade Merchant~
In the wetlands, a place like this might be called a general store.
However, in a realm where getting the basic every day neccessities
of life is a {Ddeadly{w struggle, these goods are anything but general.
Each of them has been highly specialized to fit the {yd{Ye{ys{Yer{yt{w terrain
and wear and tear that such demands would place them.

A Private Steam Bath~
This is a smaller {csteam bath{w just large enough for two people to fit in
comfortably.  Even the rather utilitarian standards of the {rT{Raa{Wr{Rda{rd{x recognize
that there are times when husband and wife would like to have a private
moment alone in the baths.  The air is sweet smelling from an i{Dnc{wen{Ds{we
brazier, and the peace and quiet of the room is augmented by the fact that
there is actually no one else using it right now.  There is a small pit of
{Dco{Ra{Dls{w in the center of the room, and clean {ystaera{w waiting to be used.

Before you is the entrance to the {Cw{cell{w, probably the most closely guarded
room in the entire hold of the {rT{Raa{Wr{Rda{rd{x.  A reinforced {ydoor{x, massive in size,
not only blocks your way, but there is also one of the largest Aiel you have
ever seen standing in front of it.  Unless you have reason to be here, it
would probably be a good idea to leave and get your water elsewhere.

water~
It can't be more than three feet deep, and maybe five feet wide,
but this natural bowl in the granite, fed by the trickle of an
underground stream is more water than you will see in one place
anywhere else in the Wastes, excepting possibly another Hold.
 
It is a wonderous site to behold...

The Dwelling of a Wise One~
This dwelling obviously belongs to the Wise One. It is kept neat,
and clean and smells strongly of burning {yincense{w. There are all
manner of {gh{Ger{gb{Ga{gl{w plants growing about the room, along
the {cwindows{w and hanging from the ceiling. There is a sort of
peaceful serenity here, as if nothing could ever truly penetrate
the aura of peace and self-assurance.
 
To the east you can see a flap around a hole which doubtless leads
towards the Wise One's bedroom.

At the Edge of a Canyon~
The ground starts sloping downward, into a canyon between the 
towering cliff walls. The ground has become {Dro{wck{Dy{w rather than
sandy now, and a lonely {cwind{w howls in the distance through
the fissures in the dark soil. It is very quiet, aside from the
wind, and oddly peaceful.
 
From here you can head west over the desert, or try your chances
downwards, in the canyon.

You stand within a fissure that is perhaps ten or twelve paces across

and above you the {Cbright blue{w sky is a ribbon of light, cut
ragged by the steep slopes of the {Dblack granite{w walls. It feels
odd to finally be in so much shade after the harsh desert {ys{Yu{ynl{Yi{yght{w.

There is an odd silence about the canyon you can't quite put your finger
on. Sounds echo about you, but do not seem to carry farther than your
immediate vicinity.

Rounding a Bend in the Canyon~
Rounding another curve, the fissure opens abrubtly into a wide canyon,
long and almost straight.  The {Dblack{w walls are startlingly {Ggreen{w in some
places with narrow terraces climbing halfway up both sides.  A few small
flat-roofed houses of g{Dra{wy s{Dt{wo{Dn{we and {yy{Yel{yl{Yo{yw c{Yla{yy{w seem to be stacked
practically on top of one another.  Ahead of you, the {Ggreen{w and frequency of

{gg{Ga{Yrd{Ge{gn{w of {ybeans{w, {Ysquashes{w, {rp{Re{rpp{Re{rrs{w, and {gm{Ge{gl{Go{gns{w.  What was previously
a dead desert wasteland seems utterly packed with life!  Chickens are
running loose, {Rredder{w than any you've ever seen, and some strange sort of
fowl, larger and s{Dpe{wck{Dle{wd g{Dra{wy is running loose with the hens.  Children,
most garbed like their elders, and tall {Wwhite-robed{w Aiel move along the
paths with big {rclay{w pitchers, apparently watering the individual plants,
careful to make sure no {cwater{w is wasted.

interior of {CC{Dold {CR{Docks {CH{Dold{x.  The chaos of the canyon lays about you,
beckoning with a myriad of bright colours and noise to the west.  Near the
entrance to the hold proper is a {Dstone house{x, two modest stone rectangles of
large bricks and glassless windows covered by plain {Wwhite{w curtains.  Like
the others, there is a vegetable garden on each of the flat rooves and
another in front of the small terrace which seperates the houses under them
by a narrow path paved with flat gray stones.  It is perhaps big enough for
two houses, and looks much like the others except for the large {ybronze{w gong
hanging beside each of the doors.

would not be the right word, it is certainly larger and more heavily
decorated than the rest of the hold.  A {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x ladder leads up the north wall
towards the roof.  To the west you can smell the pleasant scent of baking
gara {ymeatpies{w.  The east is closed off by a {wc{ro{Bl{Yo{wr{yf{gu{Wl{w array of beads strung
down over the archway.  Large comfortable looking cushions are placed in a
semi-circle around the room, with a very short round table in the middle,
made of {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{w.  The entire place gives off an aura of dignity and
simplicity.

A Cheerful Little Garden~
A sort of peaceful serenity envelopes you as you walk within this little
terraced {gg{Gar{gd{Ge{gn{w.  The {Drich soil{w, made from some sort of compost has allowed
the owner to grow all sorts of interesting vegetables and {Rf{Gru{Ri{Gt{Rs{w within the
harsh {yd{Ye{ys{Ye{yrt{w climate.  The confines of this garden are carved from the same
stone that the rest of the cliff seems to be made of.

A Garden Overlooking the Lower Hold~
This {gg{Ga{Yrd{Ge{gn{w is built atop the roof of a dwelling below.  Stone carved
into a shallow box holds all manner of {gp{Gla{gn{Gt{gs{w and is filled with {Ddark{w
and {Drich{w soil, though where it came from is anyone's guess.  A good portion
of it, however, appears to be compost.  There is a sort of peaceful serenity
you find in this garden.  As if to stand in defiance of the harsh deadly
life of the {yd{Yes{ye{Yr{yt{w and provide life despite any and all hardships.

A Terraced Vegetable Garden~
This small {gg{Gar{gd{Ge{gn{w is divided into three seperate stone
terraces containing the soil neccesary to grow a rather startling
array of vegetables. Flourishing in the garden are all sorts of 
plants, some of which have never been seen outside the hold.

Along Ledge Overlooking the Canyon~
The ledge is roughly ten feet wide, the smooth {Ddark stone{w glistens in
the light.  Over the edge of the ledge you can see the bustle of activity
below, and above it, the {gg{Gree{gns{w and {Yy{yel{Yl{yow{Ys{w of thousands of gardens and
houses stacked one atop the other.  The {cp{Cal{ce b{Clu{ce{x sky stretches out above
it, framing the area in quite a majestic fashion.  
 
To the south you can see the ledge narrow considerably. To the north, the
ledge appears to intersect a narrow path of {rr{Re{rd s{Rton{re{w.

here you could either climb downward into the base of the canyon, or you
could climb upwards towards the next level.

This {Dstone{w ladder extends for well over fifty feet.  Around you the tops
of the cliffs have become level with you.  To fall now would be certain
death.  Below you the busy {yA{Yi{We{yl{x of the hold look like little more than ants,
swarming within their colony.  Occasionally you can hear the distant
laughter of a child echo up to you.  The change in acoustics makes it a
ghostly sound, and other than that you have little but the {cmoan{w of the wind
whipping through the canyon to keep you company.

thousands of the {yy{Yel{yl{Yo{yw{w brick houses lining the walls, the people so small
in perspective they look like ants, busy at work.

The view from up here is incredible!  Even more so than from below. 
Perhaps it seems worthless to carve a ladder into the {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x, but now you can
see why.  The vast expanse of Cold Rocks Hold extends before you, all{yy{Yell{yows{x
and {Dblacks{x, with washes of {gg{Gree{gn{x on the roofs.  The people are so busy below
that they have no clue that you are here.  From this vantage point, you
could spend hours just observing the hold.  That is, if you could bare the
unshaded heat.

and the loving care to which it is given.  Along the edges are wide, narrow
flowerboxes, trailing out {gg{Gree{gn{w vines, and curious looking {Rbright red{w

like something that would occur naturally.  Far over the edges can be seen
the sprawling dwellings of the hold, easily numbering in the thousands.

A Narrow Path Between the Ledge and Houses~
This is a small simple {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{w path leading between the crevice of part of
the Canyon, and the the various {yy{Yel{yl{Yo{yw{x structures that make up the shops,
homes, and guildhalls of the Aiel in this hold.  Across the crevice you can
see other houses and gardens, and activity.

A Tanner's Shop~
This particular area of the warrens has a strong {ga{Gc{grid{w scent due to the
acids and processes involved in tanning leather.  There are all manner of
{yle{Ya{yth{Ye{yr{w goods here for sale and trade, from armor to shields, to common
leather household products.  Such craftsmanship is quite extraordinary, and
not surprising, as leather and rock are mostly all the materials the
{rA{Ri{We{rl{w have to work with.

Lex's Room~
A serene calm washes over you the moment you enter this room.  A fire
burns in the fireplace and casts a warm glow over the entire room.  The only
furniture in here consists of two cozy plush chairs.  One of them has an
open book laying on the seat, and a blanket tossed over the back, waiting
for someone to return and curl up in it.  The other is for guests, to make
them feel comfortable and at home here.

A short, pretty woman sits on a comfortable stool arranging dried {mfl{Mowe{mrs{x.

Long {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn{x curls are pinned atop this petite woman's head, keeping them
from her eyes as she works.  She wears a dress of plain {Cblue{x wool, simple
enough and cool enough for the harsh desert.  Her face is very pretty. 
Long, {Ddark{x lashes emphasize {gcl{Gov{ger{x {Ggreen{x eyes and two small dimples mark her
cheeks when she smiles.

Joric, the candy man~
A very friendly old man is here passing out {Mc{Ca{Mn{Cd{My{x sticks to the children.
~
This old man is the most friendly person you will ever meet.  He takes
great pride in his work, beaming with joy, and an almost toothless grin as
he gives small pieces of candy to the {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x children with wrinkled hands. 
His personality is a sharp contrast to the life of the desert all around. 
It makes you wonder why he braves this harsh land at his age, but at the
same time, you are glad that he does.

You recognize the markings of a {DSh{wa'm{Wad C{won{Dde{x warrior from the symbol on
this man's clothing.  While they are fierce warriors, they are not always
known for their quiet approach, and this warrior is a prime example of this.
He stomps along, appearing to make more noise than should be possible with
each footfall.  However, pointing out his lack of grace probably wouldn't be
the best course of action.

This desert creature is rather fierce-looking for its size.  It is dark
{ybrown{x, almost {Dblack{x in color, and slightly furry, if you look at it up
close.  Extending in front of its head are two large claws that are used to
hold and pinch its prey.  And at the opposite end is a very mean tail with a
sharp end that delivers paralyzing poison to anyone who dares cross this
animal's path.

This man is about average height for an {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x.  But, what sets him apart
is his size.  He isn't lean and trim like almost all of the Aiel you will
see in the Hold.  He is very heavy.  Perhaps it makes you wonder what he
does all day...  Obviously not practicing a weapon or scouting the Hold for
enemy clans.  His dark {ybrown{x hair is unkempt and {Dgraying{x slightly.  But, his
smile is friendly and inviting.  The {yan{Dim{yals{x seem to like to play with him.

The vulture is one of the desert's largest birds of prey.  It reaches a
length of 32 inches with a wing span of 6 feet.  Its overall color is
{ybrown{x-{Dblack{x with a featherless, {Rred{x head, {Wwhite{x bill and {Yyellow{x feet among
mature adults.  In flight, the vulture rocks from side to side, rarely
flapping its wings which are held at a V-angle called a dihedral. 
{WS{wi{Dlv{we{Dr{x-gray flight feathers look lighter than the {Dblack{x lining feathers of
the underwing.  Its long tail extends beyond its legs and feet in flight.

This spider has a hairy body and legs that fade from a soft {ytan{x to a

of the spider's defensive behavior against its vertebrate enemies.  When
confronted, it will rub its hind legs over its body, brushing off irritating
hairs into an enemy's eyes.  These hairs are replaced during each successive
molt.

{yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x Newbie School Entrance~
Welcome to the {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x newbie school.  Here, you will learn the ways of the
Aiel and grow to be a warrior worthy to enter the {DTh{wre{ye-{wfo{Dld {yL{Da{wn{yd{x.  Perhaps,
if you are among the elite warriors, you will be shown a glimpse of the
history of your people.  

The newbie school has been developed to give you pointers and help you
understand the code at TSW.  For those of you that are new here, pay close
attention to the words in {Rred.{x They will help you get to where you need to
go.

A Barren Desert~
Rough flats of cracked, {yy{Yel{yl{Yo{yw{Yis{yh{x-{Dg{wra{Dy{x clay stretch for miles all around.
Here and there, a flat-topped {ybutte{x reaches toward the sky, mimicking the
distant, jagged {ymo{Dun{ytains{x that line the horizon in all directions.  A few
bunches of {ybr{Yo{ywn{Yi{ysh{x {yg{gr{yass{x and some small, gnarled {gt{yre{ges{x are all that can
grow in this parched, barren landscape.  High overhead, {yvu{Wl{Dt{Ru{Dr{We{ys{x with
{Rred{x-tipped wings turn lazy circles, watching and waiting. 
 
Type "{Rlook sign{x" to continue.

A Path Leading Down Into A Narrow Canyon~
After what seems like several hours in the {Rhot{x, barren desert, you begin
to draw closer to the frightening, yet majestic mountains.  A path, made of
mixed {ydirt{x and {Ysand{x, begins downward and continues deep into a {ycanyon{x.  At
the base of the mountains, two gnarled, dead {yt{gre{yes{x worm their way from the
ground amid some {Ws{wp{Wa{wr{Wk{wl{Wi{wn{Wg{x rocks that seem to have come from nowhere. 
 
Type "{Rscan{x" to see things that are around you in each direction.

Type "{Rexit{x" to see the name of the room in each direction.

The Canyon Floor~
Canyon walls stretch and twist to the north for as far as the eye can
see.  The entrance to Newbie Hold is around here somewhere, it just can't be
seen yet.  The faint sound of {Bw{Ca{Wt{Ce{Br{x dripping can be heard in that direction
too.  The {yg{Dr{wav{De{yl{x path stretches behind you, leading back to the barren,
scorching {yd{Ye{ys{Ye{yr{Yt{x.

A Hidden Mine~
Pushing aside some rather large {Drocks{x that block the entrance, you step
into what appears to be a deserted mine.  The chipped and carved {Dw{ya{Dlls{x
provide shade, but little relief from the heat outside.  Bright {Ysu{Wnl{yi{Wg{Yht{x
floods the mouth of the cave, dimming as the tunnel extends for miles back
into the canyon {yw{Da{ylls{x. Discarded {Dst{yo{Dnes{x litter the floor, left behind
because their veins are not filled with valuable deposits of {yg{Yol{yd{x and
{Ws{wi{Dlv{we{Wr{x.  Stale {Dd{wu{Dst{x fills the air making it hard to breathe.

A Natural Spring~
Not too far off to the south, the {ycanyon{x walls weave and turn, making it
impossible to see the path that leads down to the canyon floor.  The
solitude here is almost spooky, as if someone is watching you.  The only
sound is the echo of {Bw{Ca{Wt{Ce{Br{x bubbling from a crack in the {ys{Yto{yne{x wall,
collecting in a small pool that has been carved in the {Dd{wi{Drt{x.  The {Dp{we{Wbbl{we{Dd{x
path continues to the north.  {yW{Wa{ygon{x tracks and hoof prints lead to the east.

A Peddler's Wagon~
A rickety, old peddler's wagon has been allowed to enter Newbie Hold. 
Its wheels are almost as tall and round as the brightly dressed man that
circles it, trading his wares for {yg{Yol{yd{x nuggets.  The door of the wagon is
{Wwhite-w{was{Whed{x, contrasting with the faded {Rc{Bo{Yl{Go{Cr{Ms{x that decorate the rest of
the wagon.  Two {ym{Du{yles{x are still harnessed to the tongue.  They paw
impatiently at the ground with tired hooves, wanting to be released so they
can drink water from the {Bs{Wp{Cr{bi{Wn{Bg{x to the west.  

Type "{Rlist{x" to see what the peddler has to sell.

Outside Newbie Hold~
The tall {ycanyon{x walls of Newbie Hold loom before you, providing a gentle
shade from the threatening {Ys{Wu{Yn{x.  At {Dn{wi{Wg{wh{Dt{x, however, the Hold becomes
dangerously cold, making anyone not accustomed to the climate wish they had
a {rf{Ri{Yr{re{x and a blanket, at the least.  To the north is a large doorway
protected by strands of {Rc{Yo{Gl{Bo{Mr{Wf{cu{ml{x beads.

Inside Newbie Hold~
{yG{Yol{yd{x and {Wpo{wrc{Welain{x decorate the walls and niches of Newbie Hold, creating
a very rich appearance that contrasts sharply with its plain exterior. 
Shouts and grunts echo from the walls to the east, the occasional sound of
{Ds{wp{yea{wr{Ds{x clashing can also be heard.  A long, plush {rr{Re{rd{x carpet begins in the
middle of the room and extends down a hallway to the north.

This small room is surprisingly cool, protected from the {Ys{Wu{Yn{x's searing
rays by walls that have been dug deep into the side of the {ycanyon{x.  The
floor is decorated with a richly woven rug, its fabric dyed in hues of
bright {bb{Blu{be{x and {gg{Gree{gn{x.  Shelves line the walls, covered in books that have
been collected from peddlers wagons ever since the Breaking.  An ageless
young woman stands here reading a book.  Perhaps if you ask her nicely she
will teach you all that she knows about being a Wise One.

Clear as fine {Cglass{x, perhaps a foot thick and standing three paces apart,
the columns are a forest of brilliant {Wl{Yi{Wght{x with cascading ripples and
{Rr{Ya{Gi{Bn{mb{Go{Yw{Rs{x.  The air is cooler and grimy {yd{Du{ws{yt{x covers the smooth {Wwhite m{wa{Wr{wb{Wl{we{x
beneath your feet.  

* * *

You feel different, seeing from your eyes, but not controlling your body. 
Crouching among boulders, you watch the Jenn Aiel build Rhuidean with the
Aes Sedai.  As you creep closer to the city, a man with a deep strong voice
calls your name.  {R"Mandein."  {x

{D"What do you want?"  {x

{R"You"{x Dermon replies.  {R"Whoever would lead among you must come to Rhuidean
{Rand learn where we came from, and why you do not carry swords.  Who cannot{x
{Rlearn, will not live."  {x

Mordaine, a dark eyed Aes Sedai continues {y"A day will come when the Jenn are
{yno more, and only you will remain to remember the Aiel.  You must remain, or
{yall is for nothing, and lost."  {x 

{R"You may not come to Rhuidean armed," {x Dermon says.

You hear men on horseback before you see them, three of them, riding closer
to you.
 
{R"Greetings, Rhodric.  Have your people finished filling their water skins,
{Ryet?"
 
{D"I see you, Garam," {x you reply.  {D"We are close.  Does your father withdraw
{Dhis permission for us to take water on his lands?"{x
 
{R"He does not," {x Garam said.  {R"Your grandfather wanted to know if the others

forward in his saddle.  {R"Tell me, Rhodric, are they truly the same as

Eye-splitting rings of {Wl{Yi{Wght{x run up columns around you as you draw a deep
breath.  The words still echo in your mind.  Aiel, Jenn, and enemies; that
was the world.  You had seen - lived - a time before the Aiel came to the
Three-fold Land.  

* * *

You ignore the cold snow as you watch five people approach.  You call out. 
{D"You have need of us, Jenn?"  {x

{R"You name us that to mock us," {x a tall, sharp-nosed man shouts back, {R"but
it's true.  We are the only true Aiel."  {x

You shout back.  {D"It's a lie!  I have never held a sword!"  {x Calming
yourself, you ask {D"Are you lost?"  {x 

A pretty woman, with yellow wisps of hair escaping her dark shawl speaks up.
{y"I am Morin, and we are not lost."  {x

As you lead the guests to your camp, Morin speaks bitterly of a
five-year-old daughter carried off to be raised by some other woman.  As her
story finishes, you see your father, Lewin, walking toward you.  

{g"Jeordam," {x he says, acknowledging you.  He turns to the guests.  {g"We will
bring them back.  You may stay with us if you are willing to defend yourself
and the rest of us.  If you stay, you will never be allowed back among the
wagons."  {x

Each of the men pull a spear from the ground.  So does Morin.  {y"They have my
daughter," {x she says stubbornly.  

{D"In that case, you must dress like this."  {x You motion to your cadin'sor
before reaching for her spear.  You use a hatchet to chop a pace from the
shaft, leaving four feet.  {D"Stab with it.  The haft is used for blocking."  {x
You hand the spear back.  

{y"My husband mourns my daughter already.  He cares more for the trees than
her."  {x She hefted the shortened spear.  {y"This is my husband now."  {x

{WL{Yi{Wghts{x flash through the columns, half-blinding you.  They are taking you
back into the time-lost history of the {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x.  Your feet move forward of
their own accord.  Forward.  And back in time.
 
* * *
 
You stare down into the camp with a few of your closest friends.  Your
sister is one of the blanketed lumps that you can barely see in the night
light.  You can not mourn like the others and go on like they have done so
many times before.  
 
Making your way in the darkness is not an easy task.  Crouching next to one
of the smaller heaps, you find your sister staring blankly, her face bruised
and swollen.
 
{R"I'm going to carve you like a pig, boy!"  {x One of the large mounds tumbles
aside, a long knife in his hand glitters dully in the moonlight.
 
What happens next is a blur.  You, nor any of your friends ever touch a
sword, but after the battle, the men are dead and so is your comrade,
Charlin.  You walk back to your wagons in a daze.
 
As you approach, you are surprised to see three figures running to you in
the darkness.  Your father, Adan, is one of them.
 
{y"In the name of the Light, what happened?"{x
 
You open your mouth slowly, but your sister speaks first.  {g"They killed
them.  The bad men hurt us...then Lewin came and killed them."{x
 
Your father steps back.  {y"You...killed?  Killed men?  What of the Covenant? 
We harm no one.  No one!"  {x He turns his back and strides away as if you no
longer exist.
 
You frown.  "{DMother?"  {x She turns back to you with cold eyes.  {c"Who are you
that addresses me so?  Hide your face from me, stranger.  I had a son once,
with a face like that.  I do not wish to see a killer."{x She leads your
sister away.

Wildly darting {Wl{Yi{Wghts{x bear into your eyes.  The pain of Lewin's loss

weapon.  He had not known how to use a weapon.  Killing terrified him.  It
did not make sense.  Forward, and back.   

* * *
 
You lie in the sandy hollow, clutching your dead son's children, Maigran and
Lewin.  They weep in your arms.  {D"Wait here for me," {x you tell them.
 
Some of the wagons are still burning, men with swords had done the killing. 
For once, you take no notice of the crated things the Aes Sedai had given
into Aiel charge.
 
{R"What do you mean to do now, Adan?  Tell us that!"  {x It is Sulwin, their
leader, that speaks.
 
{D"I mean to bury our dead and go on, Selwin," {x you reply.
 
{R"Go on?"  {x Selwin questions.  {R"We have no food, no water.  All we have left
are wagons full of things the Aes Sedai will never come for."{x
 
{D"We can!"  {x You shout.  {D"We will!  We have legs.  We will drag the wagons if
need be.  We will fulfill our duty."{x

to do that.  My greatfather used to tell me of when we lived in safety and
people came to hear us sing."{x
 
{D"Sing?"  {x You scoff.  {D"The songs are gone."{x
 
Some of Sulwin's followers begin to unload the wagons.  {R"Do not try to stop
us," {xhe cautions.
 
You tighten your fists.  {D"You are not Aiel.  You betray everything!"{x

forward again.

You stand at the edge of the cliff staring out westward over the
sun-sparkled water.  Walking a mile back to the wagons, your son, Adan, runs
to meet you.  {R"There are Ogier, father," {x he says excitedly.
 
It is a bedraggled band he leads you to.  You are shocked to see the Ogier
looking sad-eyed and drawn like your own people.
 
{y"You have chora cuttings," {x one of the Ogier says.
 
{R"Some," {x Adan says curtly.  {R"How bad is it to the north?"{x
 
{g"Bad," {x an Ogier woman replies.  {g"The Blight lands have grown southward."{x

take them north.  {g"I think we must find a stedding soon or die," {x the Ogier
woman continues.

pain and you double over.
 
Adan kneels beside you.  {R"Father?  What is it?"{x

{D"Take - the people - south."{x You have to force the words out between spasms

It makes no sense.  How can these people be {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x?  The columns flash in
blinding pulses.  The air stirs and swirls.  Forward.  

* * *

You hurry down the streets and slip into the Hall of Servants.  Half a dozen
Aes Sedai stand around a table arguing.  They don't notice you enter.  When
you see what is on the table, you shudder.  A crystal sword holds down the
Dragon banner of Lews Therin Kinslayer.  

You ignore the Aes Sedai.  They will see you when they are ready.  Looking
around the room, you notice a Nym.  You speak to him briefly and he
remembers the Aiel singing.  

{R"Jonai?"  {x You kneel at the sound of Solinda's voice.  {R"Is all in
readiness?"  {x 

{D"All, Aes Sedai."  {x You hesitate.  {D"Solinda Sedai, some of us wish to
remain.  We can serve still."  {x

{R"Do you know what happened to the Aiel at Tzora?  Ten thousand Aiel had
linked arms and were singing to stop a madman.  Jaric Mondoran killed them."

{x {D"As you say," {x you reply reluctantly.  {D"We will care for what you have
given into our charge until you want them again."  {x

{R"You will carry the things...  To safety, Jonai.  Keep moving, always
moving, until you find a place of safety, where no one can harm you."  {x

You run out of the city to where the great gathering waits.  The wagons are
loaded with the angreal the Aes Sedai have given you, all the things that
have to be kept from the hands of men going mad while they wield the One
Power.  

Your son, Adan, sits beside you on the wagon, grinning nervously.  A dozen
chora cuttings in clay pots sit next to him.  A foolish thing to carry,
perhaps, but they are a symbol of a better time to come.  People need hope.

filled with sheet {Wli{Ygh{Wtning{x.  The wind swirls gritty {Dd{yu{ws{Dt{x into dancing
whirlwinds.  Forward.  

* * *

You kneel at the edge of the plowed ground, in a line of others like you
that surround the field.  You are finally old enough to join in the seed
singing.  There are soldiers too.  Your father's greatfather, Charn, claimed
there had been no soldiers once, but you did not believe him.  

Charn told many stories.  He even claimed to have served Chosen Lanfear,
herself.  He said she had not always been evil.  

A Nym approaches as an Ogier begins the singing.  This is what you had been
born for.  You do not regret being passed over by Aes Sedai when you were
ten because you did not have the spark.  Being trained Aes Sedai would have
been wonderful, but surely no more that this moment.  

One of the Ogier approaches a soldier that watches the group.  {R"Do you have
news, warman?"  {x

{y"I suppose I can tell you, though it's not confirmed."  {x The solder says. 
{y"We have a report that Lews Therin led the Champions on a strike of Shayol
Ghul this morning at dawn.  The report is that Bore has been sealed and all
of the Forsaken might be inside."  

The Ogier breathed.  {R"Over at last, the Light be praised."  {x

Suddenly, something strikes you in the mouth.  A towns person spits at you. 
{g"Lanfear will not protect you anymore, Coumin.  We will root out all who
served the Forsaken and pretended to be on our side."  {x

You realize that you need to talk to Charn, you want to tell him what has
happened.  You run to the inn.  {DCharn?"  {x You shout.  Maybe he is outback
with the spice apple trees.  You run out the back door and trip over a boot
that catches your toe...  Charn's body hangs from a rope pulled over one of
the tree's branches.

seems solid, it seems to claw the nerves out of your skin.  The wind howls,
one vast whirlwind sucking inward.  Forward.

You make your way down the side of the wide, crowded street beneath the
spreading chora trees.  As you round a corner, a wide shouldered man runs
into you, sending you crashing onto your back.  

As you feel your head to see if it is cracked, the man speaks.  {R"Forgive me,
Da'shain.  Let me help you up."  {x

{D"I am not hurt, citizen," {x you say.  {D"Truly it was my fault for hurrying
like that."  {x

The man opens his mouth to protest, but before he can speak, the ground
begins to ripple under your feet.  

Desc You begin to push through the crowd, your eyes fixed on the Sharom; the
white sphere, a thousand feet in diameter floating high in the air.  Mierin
had said today female Aes Sedai and male would be able to tap the same
source.  

What looks like a tiny chip of white spins away from the Sharom in a jet
black fire; it descends, deceptively slow, insignificant.  Then hundreds of
goats spurt everywhere around the huge white sphere and the Sharom breaks
apart like an egg.  Darkness spreads across the sky, swallowing the sun. 

You run toward the Collan Daan.  You had sworn to serve the Aes Sedai, and
you are too late...

A Practice Area for Aiel Warriors~
Practice {Ds{wp{yea{wr{Ds{x are stacked against the {ys{Dt{wo{Dn{ye{x walls of this very plain
room.  The {yd{Di{Yr{yt{x floor is scuffed and marred, leaving evidence that a battle
took place not long ago.  Scratches and chips mark the walls from previous
battles.  You suspect, as you look around this practice room, that the {DSt{wo{Wne
{wD{Dog{xs are fierce, well-trained warriors.

An Aiel from an Enemy Clan~
You have cornered an {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x from an enemy clan in this room.  He snarls
maliciously at you through his {Wv{we{Wil{x.  His {Ds{yp{we{ya{Dr{x is braced and ready to
attack, even from his enclosed position.  Do you put him out of his misery,
or do you subject him to one year and one day's service as {Wga{wi'{Wsh{wa{Win{x?

Entrance to Shaido Hold~
The scorching desert floor narrows into a canyon ravine with massive
{ys{Dt{wo{Dn{ye{x walls rising on either side.  As the searing {Ys{Wu{Yn{x slowly moves across
the cloudless sky, these walls provide a bit of shade to the people that
live inside of them.  Far to the south, Aiel wearing {yea{wr{Dt{wh{yen{x hues, and some
in {Wwhite{x, scurry about their daily chores.

Canyon Walls~
The canyon walls begin to widen into a large box shaped {ycanyon{x with a
large cleft tearing south through the middle of the mesa to make room for
its inhabitants.  Rows of terraced houses are built into the mesa's steep
{yw{wa{Dl{wl{ys{x that rise to either side and a wide, natural ledge circles the inside
of these walls.  Far to the south, jutting off of the ledge, is a bluff
colored {ys{wt{yone{x with a flat surface.  The view of the Hold from this spot must
be incredible.

The entire Hold opens in front of you.  All around, terraced roofs with
irrigated {gga{yr{gd{ye{gns{x have been dug into the canyon walls.  A few scattered
tents have been staked on the Hold floor and colorful {ywa{Wgo{yns{x have circled in
the center.  About thirty feet above the canyon's floor, there is a ledge
that can be reached by taking the steep paths to the east or west.

A Path Through the Hold~
Shaido Hold extends before you, with tall canyon walls surrounding it. 
They provide momentary pockets of shade, but only in the morning or in the
evening.  A path through the Hold spreads in all directions.  From the
south, Aiel return carefully carrying pots and buckets filled with {Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{x. 
To the north, warriors guard the entrance to the Hold, making sure that no
one enters uninvited.  And, to the east and west, several roofs made from
{Yyellow {yc{wl{Da{yy{x can be seen.

A Winding Path~
A steep-walled pathway begins here, leading from the floor of the Hold to
the top ridge that circles the {ycanyon{x walls about thirty feet up.  Here, on
the lower part of the path, the ground is gently sloped and fairly wide,
leading to a small gathering area approximately five paces above the Hold
floor.  Dozens of roofs are built along this stretch.  Most of them open
directly onto the main path rather than onto smaller branch pathways.  The
{Dpe{wb{Wb{wl{Ded{x trail continues up to the east.  The entrance to Shaido Hold is only
about hundred paces away to the west.

The Beginning of a Steep Path~
A path begins here, leading up the {ycanyon{x wall to the ledge and the roofs
above.  The ground is very steep and perilous, making anyone who takes this
path wish that there was a {Wr{wo{Wpe{x bolted to the side of the trail for support.
Steep, short stairs have been carved into the {ys{wt{Do{wn{ye{x to further the ascent,
but whether they make it easier or not is still left to be known.  One thing
is for certain, if you fall down the stairs it will certainly hurt more.

Outside a Guest Roof~
This pathway offers a spectacular view of the eastern side of the canyon,
but provides little in the way of shelter from the squeltering heat of the
day.  The vegetation you see growing from the canyon wall is {ybrown{x and
appears to be little more than dried husks growing above a roof.  To the
north, built into the wall, you notice a well-carved doorway with a small
pathway leading up to it.

A dozen roofs made of {yye{Yll{wo{Ywi{ysh{x-clay are hidden in the northern wall of
this western portion of the Hold.  It is quieter here, not so much hustle
and bustle like there is around the trading circle.  Most of the roofs in
this area are small and hold nothing of interest.  But at {Dnight{x, the roof
directly to the north echoes with the sounds of drunken laughter.

floors have been neatly swept and everything seems to be in place for happy

The long {yc{wl{Da{yy{x path through the camp brings you to one of the sections of
the Hold built for families.  {yC{wa{Dnv{wa{ys{x sheets hide doorways to the west and to
the north, serving as temporary doors until {ywooden{x ones can be purchased
from a traveling trader.  The homes are made of {yb{Yri{yck{x and {yc{wl{Da{yy{x, dug deep
into the rock of the canyon wall to protect their inhabitants from the heat.
To the south and to the east, the well worn path continues, leading to the
more commercial parts of the Hold.

clay on the path through the camp.  It causes the dry twigs on the {ysa{gg{Deb{wr{gu{ysh{x
around the west path to rustle together, making sounds almost like those of
a poisonous rattle snake.  To the north, dozens of {Yyellow{x brick roofs are
built into the canyon wall.  The entrance to the stone garden is to the

And, the northern part of the room is separated by a {Wgossamer{x curtain,

Huge {ywooden{x pillars support the entry to this old, deserted mine that
runs several miles back into the canyon wall.  {ySa{gg{Debr{gu{ysh{x partially blocks
the entrance, making it a bit more difficult to get into because the
branches have to be pushed aside or crawled through.  Once inside, however,
it is large enough to stand in and is several people wide.  Sunlight only
reaches in a few feet before it disappears, leaving those without a lantern
to wander in the {Ddarkness{x.

table.  The table is littered with {Ds{wt{Won{we{Ds{x and tools.  This is where the

This area is the equivalent of a park in the wetlands.  It is a section
of the Hold made of tumbled {ybo{Du{wld{De{yrs{x stacked against the western wall which
provide semi-shaded areas to rest and play.  Paths meander around the stones
that have not been stacked.  {gC{Ga{Wc{Yt{Gu{gs{x and a few tufts of grass grow along
these paths.  The stone garden is also a place for {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x couples to escape
for some time alone, hidden from the eyes of the Hold.  The path continues
to the west.  To the east, you will be engulfed by crowds at the trading
circle.

It is quite incredible that anything other than {gca{Gct{gus{x and dead {ygr{Ga{yss{x can

A Mine Shaft~
The floor of the mine slants continually downward, going farther and
farther underground.  It should be getting a bit cooler because the sun does
not shine this far into the mine, but heat still flows from drafts at the
entrance to the mine, so it is just as hot here.  Holding a {yla{Yn{Wt{Ye{yrn{x out in
front of you, you can see specks of {yd{wu{Ds{yt{x and maybe even {Da{ws{Dh{x floating in the
air.  It is probably not the safest atmosphere to be breathing.

longer produces perspiration on the skin.  Large {Dr{wo{Dc{wk{Ds{x, shining with
{ymi{Yn{We{Yra{yls{x, litter the floor.  They were either discarded as worthless, or
they were left behind when it was determined the mine was no longer safe to
work in.  That is why people do not come here to enjoy the cooler air.

The mine stops against a dark, chiseled wall.  It creates a ovular cave,
large enough for a few peddlers wagons to stand side to side, if they could
get down here.  The cavern is quite unusual, unlike anything most {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x have
seen.  Large stalactites and stalagmites hang from the ceiling and the
floor.  Sometimes they meet in columns.  The faint sound of {Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{x dripping
is the source of these formations, but there isn't nearly enough to drink
and it is too {Wsalty{x to be palatable.

The western wall of Shaido Hold looks like nothing more than a pile of
{ybo{wu{Dld{we{yrs{x carelessly strewn about or left as waste.  Nothing could be farther
from the truth however.  After looking around again, the organization and
beauty of the garden becomes apparent.  Tall spires of {yr{wo{Dc{yk{x extend up to
various heights against the canyon wall, many as large as two {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x.  They
dot the landscape and rise upward from the boulder piles like stinging
nettles or dried grass.  Climbing through these boulders can be an endless
maze.

The winding pathways around the {yr{wo{Dc{yks{x and over them provide many places
for children to hide and play during the day.  It's not uncommon to hear the
voices of children and their laughter echoing from the west end of the Hold
when their chores and schooling are done.  There is a favorite {ybo{wu{Dl{wd{yer{x in
the center of the stone garden, called the Naming Rock, where children have
used small {Dd{wag{Wg{wer{Ds{x to carve their names into the sides.

The Stone Garden~
Set to the side of spires that rise high into the air, ledges have been
created.  Some are man-made and others are natural, but all of them are
carefully created and maintained to hold an artist's masterpiece.  These
works of art are small {yr{wo{Dc{yk{x statues, carefully stacked and arranged to cast
{Dshadows{x that look like creatures or people.  It is romantic and quiet here
because the children are not allowed to touch the sculptures.  So lovers,
young and old, come here to retreat in the semi-privacy of the garden, still
within the safety of the Hold.

scattered around on the ground.  Some of them extend quite high into the
air, high enough that if someone were to fall from them, they would be hurt.
A path has been carved around the larger {yr{wo{Dc{yks{x, making it easier to stroll
through this park and enjoy its beauty.  Life does exist here among the
shading rocks, some dried looking {ypl{ga{ynts{x and {ygr{gas{Gs{yes{x sprout from beneath the
{ybo{wu{Dld{we{yrs{x and several species of desert creatures thrive here because of the
seclusion.

This guest room is the newest roof in the Hold.  It is quite spectacular
and not at all what you'd expect in an {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x Hold, mainly because of the
decor that the merchant's wife has added during her stay.  The walls are
smooth, well-finished, and radiate coolness, something you don't expect in
this hot, arid climate.  A raised {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x platform serves as the resting place
for a stuffed mattress covered with a brightly colored {Gbl{Ya{Cn{Yk{Get{x, obviously
brought in on the merchant's wagon.

At first glance, the yellow {yb{Yri{yck{x guest roofs built into the eastern wall

the windows and {Rb{Ye{Ba{Gd{me{Wd{x doorways leading into them.  As the guests settle
down, gai'shain enter their roofs, presenting them with towels to wash and a
{Ws{wi{Dlv{we{Wr{x cup of water as a formal greeting.  There are unusual markings on the
ground.  They look like hoof prints that vanish to the east.

and stuffed cushions and pillows are strewn about in carefully planned
disarray.  Gossamer {Wv{we{Wi{wl{Ws{x hang down between pillars of worked stone,
creating smaller sectioned areas for private groups.  Both men and women
stay here, because nakedness is not taboo to the Aiel.  At certain spots in

have been carved into the walls to allow air to circulate through the roofs.
If it weren't for these holes, the roofs would blend into the canyon walls
and no one would ever see them.  The doorway of the roof to the east is hung

A pile of {ygr{gas{ys{x has been neatly stacked on the floor for the horses to eat.
Amid the pile of straw, {Ds{wo{Wm{De{wt{Wh{Di{wn{Wg{x looks out of place, like it has been mixed

A Path Through the Camp~
The {yc{wl{Da{yy{x floor of the canyon leads to the eastern half of the Hold. 
Directly to the east, warriors train and hone their skills, learning to be
deadly fighters like their fathers.  Immediately to the north is the section
of the Hold built to house guests.  It serves as a dwelling place for
visitors who do not wish to stay with their society or family members.  It
is the newest section of the Hold.

The combat yard comprises a wide stretch of cleared {yl{wa{Dn{yd{x on the eastern
edge of the Hold floor.  During the day, the warriors of the Hold come here
to practice and hone their skills with {ysp{we{Da{yrs{x, {yb{wo{yws{x and {Dk{wn{Wiv{we{Ds{x.  Several
roofs join into the practice area from paths that lead among them.

The Combat Yard~
The sound of shouts and grunts echo all around as {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x warriors, young
and old, practice their attacks on one another.  The deep voice of the
instructor billows above the rest, giving orders and guidance to those that
are fighting.  A pile of practice weapons lays here in front of the roof
that is built into the east wall.  A {Wg{wa{Wi{x'{Ws{wh{Wa{wi{Wn{x stands to the left of this
pile, ready to fetch weapons or {Bw{Ca{Wt{Ce{Br{x for the fighters that need them.

This roof has specifically been built for a shaded practice area.  It is
void of any decoration, except for the several marks that have been gouged
into the walls from careless {ys{wp{Dea{wr{ys{x and {Dk{wn{Wiv{we{Ds{x.  The floor is scuffed from
scattering feet, making the {yc{wl{Da{yy{x powdery instead of hard.  In random spots,

This roof belongs to a seasoned instructor of the Shaido clan.  It is a
plain, masculine room with a few {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn{x statues and treasures that have been
placed inside nooks carved into the walls.  A dark, worn {Drug{x adorns the
middle of the room and in a corner, there is a pile of {yf{wu{Dr{ys{x and {Ww{woo{Wl{x skins
that looks as if its used for sleeping.  Bones and other remnants from last

warriors to hone their skills.  Aside from the smaller routes that lead to
the private roofs belonging to seasoned warriors, there is an path leading
to the west where the trading {ywa{Wgo{yns{x have circled.  To the south lies the
gathering area of Shaido Hold.

This clearing, in the midst of all the {yt{Yen{yts{x and {yr{wo{Do{yfs{x, seems to be the
epicenter of action for the Hold.  Men and women hurry about carrying food
items for daily meals or treasures they have purchased from the Trading
Circle to the south.  Most importantly, however, is the {ys{wt{Do{wn{ye{x {Dw{we{Dll{x built in
the middle of the path.  Without water to sustain life, this Hold would be

belonging to peddlers that have come from beyond the Dragonwall to trade
with the {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x.  They are situated in a circle for protection, but also so
that the Hold might easily reach them.  When the peddlers aren't here, there
are frequently traders from other Holds who bring their tents and offer
their wares for trade.  All around, the roofs of the Hold can be seen,
including the Roofmistress' overlook to the south.  It is the highest point
protruding out over the Hold.  To the east and west, the trading circle
continues.

boys have given up spear practice for this gift.  A large variety of goodies
are stacked in the wagon, ranging from sticks of {Dlicorice{x to {rs{Ru{rc{Rk{re{Rr{rs{x.  A
small treasure of {yc{Dh{yo{Dc{yo{Dl{ya{Dt{ye{x lays in a pit dug out beneath the {ywa{Wgo{yn{x to keep
it from melting.

{bf{Ba{Wbr{Bi{bc{x rest in one of the corners of the tent.  Exquisite handcrafted toys
and dolls line the shelves and tables, looking so life-like they could
almost walk on their own.  An old man pays you no heed as he sits upon a
worn stool with a piece of wood in one hand and a knife in the other,
whittling away at the wood with precision and patience.

covers it from the trip into the Three-fold Land.  Its owner is well dressed
too.  Perhaps he is a wealthy merchant from the wetlands here to try his
luck with the {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x.  Gingerly, he places an ornately jeweled {D{ww{Wo{wr{Dd{x on top of
his {yf{wu{Dr{ys{x.  What he doesn't know is that an Aiel would never touch a sword,
not even to remove the {gg{Gem{gs{x set into it.

stacked on the ground.  When the jars are opened, some bitter scents escape,
while others smell nauseatingly sweet.  {DP{wi{Dpes{x of different shapes and sizes
are displayed on top of the jars.  A woman who isn't ashamed of what she
wears watches you with {yh{gaz{yel{x eyes, smiling {Rw{ra{Rr{rm{Rl{ry{x.

The Trading Circle~
Several {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x approach the trading circle from the south end, looking for
some necessities and also a few luxuries that are popularly sought, like
lace, velvet, ribbon, needles, pins, perfume, tabac, bath salts, wine and
brandy.  They have little interest in things like pots and knives because
their smiths are very skilled in making these items.  Also, silk can be
fetched at a cheaper price from Sharan traders, so it rarely sells here. 
The Aiel don't use a lot of currency.  Instead, they trade with {yg{Yol{yd{x or
{Ws{wi{Dlv{we{Wr{x nuggets.  They are skilled at assessing an object's value and they
bargain hard.

he has left a {ywooden{x bench in front of his wagon for the comfort of his
customers and he wonders why no one ever uses on it.  More hustle and bustle
can be heard to the north and east as the trading circle continues.

feminine, catering to Aiel lovers and husbands who have upset their wives.

From this spot, you can see continuous rows cut into the sides of the

Roofmistress or Clan Chief calls an assembly.  The Roofmistress' Ledge juts
out several feet, making it easy for the speaker to be seen and heard
because of the acoustics.  Upon arrival, the {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x group by warrior

Just beneath the Roofmistress' Overlook, the walls of the {ycanyon{x draw in
sharply.  They have been carved into several wide, flat tiers which can
accommodate all of the residents of the Hold when a gathering is called. 
The southern exit of the Hold is several hundred feet away, guarded by
fierce {Dwa{wr{Wri{wo{Drs{x that look quite solemn while they are on duty.  Even at this
distance, they are still able to hear the words spoken by the Clan Chief or
Roof Mistress because the echo carries so well.

The southeastern section of the Hold has been built inside a large
clearing.  Instead of building roofs, the Aiel have chosen, for whatever
reason, to use tents.  They have been set up in rows, with a {Dd{wus{Dty{x {yc{wl{Da{yy{x path
running between them.  All of the tents are made from an {yea{wr{Dt{wh{yen{x toned
{yc{wa{Dn{yv{wa{Ds{x, except for one tent to the south that is starched {Wwhite{x.  It stands
out like a sore thumb among the others.  The tent to the north displays a

A Path Through the Camp~
With the {Ys{Wu{Yn{x high over head, you imagine this path resembles more of an
oven than a walkway leading someplace.  In this heat, an {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x wedding has
taken place.  When a woman is to marry, if she does not already own one, her
family builds a roof for her.  This new {yb{wr{Wi{wd{ye{x's home has been built to the
north.  On this day, her wedding day, her new husband carries her away from
her family across his shoulder, with his brothers holding off her sisters. 
But, at the door, he puts her down and asks her permission to enter.  The
roof is hers.

Weaving is one of the most important crafts among the {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x, next to
metalworking.  Textiles such as {Wwool{x and {yg{Yra{yss{x are woven into a variety of
fabrics.  The wool comes from the few {Ws{whe{Wep{x and {ygo{wa{Dt{ys{x that are tended by
Aiel herders on the small farms at the edges of the Hold.  The weaver that
inhabits this shop produces cloth by the bolt to replace the oft-torn
{yca{wd{Din'{ws{yor{x.  Her floor is littered with scraps of {yfa{wb{Dr{yic{x and pieces of thread
as well as comfortable {rcu{Rsh{rio{Rns{x.  On the western wall, she displays her
finished items for you to buy.

protect the family from the elements, and a {rf{Ri{Yr{We-{Yp{Ri{rt{x set up near a corner

specifically for sleeping, because the {Wg{wa{Wi's{wh{Wa{wi{Wn{x are out during the day
serving the {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x of this Hold for one hundred and one days.  Even at night,
some of the beds remain unused if their service is required.  The tent's
interior is very simple.  The only decorations are a few spare robes that
are neatly folded at the foot of each bed.

wall, but shelter is available close by in tents.  To the north, many
{Wga{wi'{Wsh{wa{Win{x scurry about.  And to the south, especially after a Sept raid on
the Hold's {yc{wa{Dt{yt{wl{De{x or a bad afternoon at practice, the sound of moaning can
be heard from wounded warriors.  Footprints in the {yd{wu{Ds{yt{x also lead to the
west where the faint sound of a piper piping can be heard.

different than the rest in the Hold, but it appears that you have found a
very important place.  {WGa{wi'{Wsh{wa{Win{x rush to and fro, some carrying {Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{x,
others holding fuel for {rf{Ri{Yr{re{x.  There are two maidens posted outside of the
roof to the east, guarding all those who wish to enter.  And, you might
notice that those entering the tent to the west have already started to
remove their {yca{wd{Din'{ws{yor{x, eager for a sweat bath.

time to time, they meet with society members from other clans to try and
mediate conflicts or try to put {rb{Rloo{rd{x feuds to rest.  For obvious reasons,
this {yt{we{Dn{yt{x is well attended by {Wga{wi'{Wsh{wa{Win{x seeing to the guest's needs.  The
furnishings are plush and expensive, all made of {Ws{wi{Wl{wk{x and {rve{Rlv{ret{x, from the
carpets to the cushions.  Gilded {yla{Yn{Wte{Yr{yns{x are placed around the tent to

those making the oath hold cups of water for the other to drink.

Multitudes of annoying {Df{wl{Dies{x buzz around the room.

A Path Through Camp~
Hard-packed {ye{wa{yr{wt{yh{x is dry and baked beneath your feet all around.  To
either side of the path, many personal dwellings have desert {gpl{Ga{yn{gts{x blooming
in personal gardens built on their roof.  The plants need almost constant
{Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{ci{Cn{cg{x to stay alive in the hot {Ys{Wu{Yn{x.  To the north, the communal {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x
garden has been built, while southward lies the merchant roofs.  Somewhere
in the distance you here the cry of a {yb{wi{Dr{yd{x of prey.

An Aiel Family Roof~
{yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x homes are carved out of the {ys{wt{Do{wn{ye{x walls of the Hold, with facades of
{yc{wl{Da{yy{x and {rbrick{x.  Food crops are grown on their flat roofs.  The rooms within
are spacious and comfortable.  They have few furnishings except for bright
{br{Bug{bs{x, tapestries, {Rcu{rsh{Rio{rns{x and a few shelves and tables.  They are decorated
with fine {Ws{wt{Wa{wt{Wu{we{Ws{x and other goods looted during raids and battles or traded
from Shara.  The colors are bright and contrast with the {yea{wr{Dt{wh{yen{x hues that
they wear.

Shrinking Canyon Walls~
Along the {ycanyon{x walls, you start to see small, flat-roofed houses of {Dgray{x
{Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x or {Yyellow {yc{wl{Da{yy{x seeming to be stacked practically atop one another, in
clusters with paths winding between, and atop every roof a garden of {gb{Gean{gs{x
and {Ysq{yuash{Yes{x, peppers and melons and plants growing beneath the hot desert
{Ys{Wu{Yn{x.  Chickens run loose, {rre{Rdd{rer{x than those in the wetlands, and some
strange sort of fowl, larger and speckled {Dgray{x.  Children, most garbed like
their elders, wander, eating flat, pale bread made from zemai, gara and
bloodsnake.  And {Wwhite{x-robed {Wga{wi'{Wsh{wa{Win{x move among the gardens, with big clay
pitchers {Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{ci{Cn{cg{x individual plants.

Shrinking Canyon Walls~
The fissure continues to open into the wide {ycanyon{x, long and almost
straight.  To a wetlander, the Hold spreading before your eyes would appear
to be a fair-sized town.  The canyon walls are {gg{Gree{gn{x and sheer, with a
narrow terrace wrapping around the walls halfway up.  Along powdery {yc{wl{Da{yy{x
paths leading to farms to the east and west, round fruits, too {Rred{x and shiny
for apples grow on low, pale-leaved {Gbu{Wsh{Ges{x.  Straight, broad-leafed stalks
lined with long, fat, {Yye{yl{Ylow{x-tasseled spouts grow along the path as well,
blooming in groups.

A Deserted Mine~
An old {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x mine is here in the southern section of the Hold.  Its walls
bare the marks of picking and scraping to obtain the minerals within.  The
dust has settled and the bootprints have disappeared, giving into the dry
{yde{ws{De{yrt{x gusts that occasionally sweep the floors.  In its day, the Aiel mined
{yg{Yol{yd{x and {Ws{wi{Dlv{we{Wr{x, as well as many precious ores from its walls.  They also
mined {rru{Rbi{res{x, {bsa{Bpphir{bes{x, {Wmo{Yon{Ds{wt{Yon{Wes{x and {rf{Ri{Yr{re{x drops, though none of these
gems were facet-cut in their work.  They were favored merely as decoration
and not valued highly, as they would be in the wetlands.

A Stone Arch~
Entering the Hold under a stone archway, you are advised to uncover your
face and make noise to make it clear that you're not trying to sneak in for
an attack.  Heading north, you walk to the widest fissure in the sheer {ys{wt{Do{wn{ye{x
wall, ten or twelve paces across at the broadest, and {Dsh{wa{Wdo{ww{Ded{x by the height
of its sheer sides as it weaves deeper and deeper, {Ddark{x and even cool
beneath a ribbon of {Csky{x.  It is odd that there is so much shade.  After
passing through the crevice, the {ycanyon{x opens into the Hold, with farm land
on either side.

Outside Shaido Hold~
Standing in front of a {ys{wt{Do{wn{ye{x archway that leads into Shaido Hold, you
notice the land around you.  To the left, patches of tough {yg{gra{yss{x and
leafless {Ds{wp{Wi{wn{Dy{x plants, scattered thorny bushes and low {ytr{ge{yes{x, across arid
hills and jagged gullies, past huge, rough {ys{wt{Do{wn{ye{x columns to jagged mountains
in the distance.  To the right the land is the same, except the cracked
{yye{Yll{yow{Yis{yh c{wl{Da{yy{x lays flatter, the mountains closer.  Without the knowledge
that this crevice leads into a familiar canyon, you might think that you are
standing in any piece of the Three-fold Land from here to Chaedar.

The Aiel Waste - Nearing a Hold~
Nearing the entrance to Shaido Hold, you have a moment to reflect on the
people that live here.  Their lives must not be easy living in the middle of
a barren {yd{we{Dse{wr{yt{x where it never {Cr{ca{Ci{cn{Cs{x.  The {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x have given their environment
a name - the Three-fold Land.  Asking them to define their homeland, they
will tell you that it is a shaping stone to make them, a testing ground to
prove their worth and a punishment for their sins.

Tall and fair, the {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x wear {ycl{wo{Dth{we{ys{x to their hands and faces to keep
from burning, though none from the wetlands would be able to catch sight of
them unless they wished it.  In their clothes of {ybrowns{x and {Dgrays{x, they can
hide unseen only paces from you, and can disappear in to depressions that
would not hide a dog.  Not a comforting thought, considering the deadly
skill {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x have with their short {ys{wp{Dea{wr{ys{x, and their hostility toward
outsiders.  Here, a group of unwanted guests are being lined up, preparatory
to being sold to the land of Shara.

The Aiel Waste - Nearing a Hold~
Surprisingly, in this harsh and uninviting {yde{ws{De{yrt{x, a culture thrives.  On
the horizon, the crevice leading to the entrance of Shaido Hold can be seen.
Thought to be savages by most other lands, and known to be among the most
deadly warriors in the world, the {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x survive where most would die of
thirst within a day.  Digging their homes deep into the {yr{wo{Dc{yk{x walls of
canyons and cliffs, they gather in here around a {Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{x source and till the
poor {ys{wo{Di{yl{x for their strange crops.

A small farm has been developed here on the edge of the Hold.  A variety of
{yc{wa{Dtt{wl{ye{x and {Ws{whe{Wep{x graze on the dry {yg{Yra{yss{x of the desert floor, but this is
clearly not enough to support their diet.  As a result, this old {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x herder
relies on peddlers to bring {Yhay{x into Hold with their wagons.  If the
peddlers arrive late, the herder is forced to move his herd to other
locations near the Hold so that they can feed, but not be too far away from
precious {Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{x.

A Small Farm~
This section of farm land has been developed like the acreage belonging
to the {yta{gb{yac{x farmer.  The ground has been plowed and molded into irrigation
rows where {gg{Gras{gs{x seed has been planted for cattle to graze upon.  Although
the grass is sparse, and generally eaten before it is more than inch tall,
it seems to be enough to sustain the {ya{wn{Di{ym{wa{Dl{ys{x that feed here.  Farm hands,
generally {Wga{wi'{Wsh{wa{Win{x or children, use buckets to flood the irrigation
channels, {Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{ci{Cn{cg{x the grass twice a day.

crops are methodically planted for at least an acre or two.  Each row sits
next to a well-kept {Cir{cri{Cga{cti{Con{x channel that currently is dry and empty. 
There is a large, covered cylinder {Wtub{x perched upon a tall {ys{wt{Do{wn{ye{x.  It is
opened two or three times a day, allowing {Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{x to flood these channels and
keep the {yta{gb{yac{x crop flourishing.

Efficiency is apparent everywhere on this little farm.  The animals, even

of dry, shady {yb{gus{yhes{x are found in order to minimize the amount of {Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{x they

smoke to escape.  A few {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x tables are built around the room.  Some of
them are bare, allowing room for the baker to kneed dough and some of them
hold {ybread{x or small pastries that are fresh from the oven.  The aroma of

want to be near the society roofs, but not live inside of them.  No family
roofs are located here, because mothers with small children do not want to
live up where it is so dangerous.  The roofs that are carved into the {ycanyon{x
walls here are accessed by small paths that branch off the main trail at
almost every imaginable angle.

that the storyteller took when his battles were over.  The niches on the
walls hold {Ds{wta{Wt{wue{Ds{x and pictures while {mt{Map{De{wst{Dr{Mie{ms{x decorate the spaces between
them.  Massive stone pillars hold burning {yla{Yn{wte{Yr{yns{x to light the room, and

end.  Old, drying {ysa{gge{Db{wr{Du{gsh{yes{x and a single {gca{Gct{gus{x with blooming {Yfl{Wo{Gw{Ye{Yrs{x

still serve as protection to anyone that might be drunk or careless.  Having
climbed the jagged, steep trail to the north, many {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x stop here to admire
the view of the Hold thirty feet below them.  It really is quite a sight to
see with all the hustle and bustle of the people below.  Faint laughter and
even a {Rg{Yl{Ge{ce{Bm{Wa{Mn{x's song can be heard, carried by an echo from below.

direction.  A narrow ledge to the north leads to a rather large looking
roof.  It stands on the pinnacle of the ridge circling the {ycanyon{x, perched
solidly atop the crags like an {ye{Da{Wg{Dl{ye{x protecting its lair.  This roof must
belong to some of Shaido Hold's fiercest warriors.

Not far from this narrow section of the {yledge{x, society roofs can be seen.
But here, the ground is so narrow that it can only be traversed one at a
time, supporting the {yfo{wot{Dpr{win{yts{x of those that travel the ridge thirty feet
above the floor of the Hold.  A gentle trail of {Dsmoke{x is rising from a

room in the {Dblack{wsm{Wi{wth{x's roof.  All around, a dozen other roofs cluster on
this same ledge, with even more to the north that form around a steep path
that leads to this upper ledge of the {ycanyon{x.  To the south, a deep {rr{Re{rd{x roof
can be seen.  It stands out among the others in the Hold, marking it as a
place of significance.  Also, standing here, one can see all the way across
the Hold, to the ledge on the other side.  A deep crevice runs into the
canyon wall and Aiel {Dwa{wr{Wri{wo{Drs{x continually pass in and out of it.

The path around the upper edge of the Hold continues to the north and the
south, leading to roofs of the more prominent warriors and leaders of Shaido
Hold.  The roof directly to the south is built from {rred{x {yc{wl{Da{yy{x bricks and
stands out among the others.  It must be pretty important to have earned
such a distinction.  To the north, there is another roof that is quite
important to the Hold.  {DS{wm{Wo{wk{De{x rises from a chimney in its roof, drifting
away in the cloudless desert {Csky{x.

Outside a Roof~
Continuing around the upper rim of the canyon, you come to a roof that is
different from the others.  It is made from {rr{Re{rd{x clay bricks instead of
{yy{Yello{yw{x and stands out rather prominently when viewed from the Hold below. 
The path in front of this roof is bordered by large {Ds{wt{Won{we{Ds{x, making it safe
for people to pass without the threat of falling over the side.  Two rather
tall {gbu{Gsh{ges{x grow on either side of the entrance to the roof.  They have been
carved into spiral shapes and must be {Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{ce{Cd{x several times a day in order
for them to survive.

A Path Around the Ledge~
The warm, dry wind blows across the ridge stirring up the dry, cracked
{yc{wl{Da{yy{x and making the powder painful if it enters your eyes.  The small {Dd{wus{Dt
d{wevi{Dl{x on the ledge continues, but only briefly, before it dissolves,
becoming dust for you to leave your {yfo{wot{Dpr{win{yts{x in.  On days when the wind
storms are particularly bad, the {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x seek relief inside their roofs.

A Blacksmith's Roof~
This part of the roof occupies the ledge that curves into the {ycanyon{x
walls.  It is unfavorable to work here in the morning hours because the hot,
rising {Ys{Wu{Yn{x is not shaded by the canyon walls.  Therefore, the Hold
{Dblack{wsm{Wit{whs{x must work inside until later in the day.  Heaps of {yd{wu{Dn{yg{x are
piled against the walls to be used in heating and shaping the {Dm{we{Wt{wa{Dl{x.  For
most of the day, the apprentice is put to work stocking the ovens with their
fuel.  Only in the early evening hours can his {Da{wnv{Dil{x be heard echoing
throughout the Hold.

A rather large {Wc{wo{Wbw{we{Wb{x has been built between the canyon wall and smaller
{ybo{wu{Dld{we{yrs{x and {gc{Gact{gi{x lining the narrow ridge dropping to the canyon floor. 
The silky threads glisten in the {yg{Yo{Wld{Ye{yn{x sunlight, seemingly unaffected by
the heat.  It looks very complicated, probably taking the {ys{wp{Di{yd{we{Dr{x most of the
evening to weave.  It would be a shame to ruin this masterpiece, especially
if it left the spider with no reward for all of its effort.

The Roofmistress' Overlook~
Standing on the edge of this open, flat ledge of cut {yr{wo{Dc{yk{x, one can see
the entire Hold spanning the canyon thirty feet below.  In the center, you
can see the well that holds precious {Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{x, continuing to support the {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x
that live here, even today.  Hundreds of roofs can also be seen lining the
canyon walls, marked with patches of {gg{Gree{gn{x atop each one.  To the south,
there is a modest roof of large {yy{Yello{yw{x-{yc{wl{Da{yy{x bricks with narrow, glassless
windows covered by plain {Wwhite{x curtains, a {gve{Gge{gt{Gab{gle{x garden on its flat roof
and another in front on a small terrace separated from the house by a narrow
path paved with flat {Dgray s{wt{Won{we{Ds{x.  Maidens and Wise Ones continually come
and go from roofs to the west and to the east, the hammer of the
blacksmith's anvil can be heard.

Hold while they have discussions about its well-being.  Small, dry patches
of {gg{yr{ga{ys{gs{x line the edges, as well as a few dog-size {ybo{wu{Ddl{we{yrs{x to keep it safe.

The Maidens' Ledge~
Like the Roof Mistress' overlook, the ledge outside the Maidens' roof
rises thirty feet from the canyon floor and is recessed in to the {yr{wo{Dc{yk{x wall.
Small spires and {ybo{wu{Dld{we{yrs{x line the outer edge of the ledge, creating an open
space with a secluded feel.  Some of the larger boulders are worn flat on
top where Maidens have sat for many generations, watching the Hold and the
people below.  A {Rb{Ye{Ga{Bd{We{md{x door to the south leads to the Maidens' Roof. 
Farther to the east, underneath a stone overhang, is the entry to the Roof
Mistress' roof.  Several other roofs share this ledge, all {gga{Grd{gen{x topped,
though none directly face the Maidens' roof.

it appears on the exterior.  The entry floor is laid with {ybrown{x tiles that
extend farther back into the roof to other rooms that have been carved into
the canyon wall.  The rooms have high ceilings and are surprisingly cool,
with wide, arched doorways and {Ws{wi{Dlv{we{Wr{x lamps that give off a scent of {gg{Gree{gn{x
places.  Intricately woven {bc{Ba{yr{Yp{ye{Bt{bs{x cover the floor.  Many of their patterns
come from Tear and Cairhien, Andor and even Illian.  The colors in the room
are in sharp contrast to the harsh sameness outside the Hold.

kept and cleaned immaculately without a speck of {yd{wu{Ds{yt{x from the outside to be

A Path Along the Ledge~
The {ys{Yu{yn{x beats down on this section of the path, especially in the
afternoon.  Because it is a trail around the upper section of the Hold,
there is no {Dshade{x.  Only roofs can be sought to protect oneself from the
daytime heat that can kill those unaccustomed to it.  At night, however, the
{yde{ws{De{yrt{x cools down considerably and can be quite inviting, if you are used to
it.  Looking out across the Hold, roofs in the valley below can be seen. 
Also, many homes on the eastern ledge of the Hold are visible from this
spot, especially a roof with {Wsteam{x rising from a vent in the top.  It is a
bit south of here, but still quite visible.

roof to the north.  This doorway is guarded by two huge {yst{wa{Dt{wu{yes{x in the shape
of dogs in alert position.  They are meant to ward off trespassers and to
also warn of the fierceness of the warriors inside.  To the west, the steep
path can be taken to the bottom floor of the Hold to enjoy the practice
yards, the stone garden or the trading circle.

provides the basis for the beginning of a {ys{wt{Do{wn{ye{x ledge that circles the
{ycanyon{x walls all around.  All of the society roofs are found up here, as
well as several other roofs that have been orderly arranged, forming rows
upon rows of terraces which provide the areas for the growing {yc{gr{Do{yps{x and
other {gp{Gla{gnt{x life.

Here on the ridge overlooking the city below, any {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x should feel safe
because they stand between two of the toughest warrior's roofs in the Hold. 
Scanning to the west, one might see two large {ys{wt{Do{wn{ye{x statues of dogs, or to
the east, a roof that stands on the pinnacle of the ledge, looking out over
the Hold protectively like an {ye{wa{Dg{wl{ye{x guarding its nest.  When the view grows
tiresome, if that is possible, the ground level of the Hold can be accessed
by taking a jagged, winding trail to the east, or a steep path to the west.

to the north.  It is hidden by {Wwhite l{wac{We{x curtains.  The {ybrown{x tile floor is
protected by a woven {Rr{Yu{Gg{x made of interlacing stripes of various {Rc{Yo{Gl{Ro{Yr{Gs{x. 
And, like the first floor, there is a {Ws{wi{Dlv{we{Wr{x lamp hanging from the ceiling,
scenting the room with its light fragrance.  A {Wr{yo{Wpe{x ladder climbs the east
wall, leading to the top of the roof.  To the south, an arched doorway is
hidden by rows of {Rb{Ye{Ga{Bd{Ms{x.

A Dining Room~
After washing your face and hands with a damp towel, a meal is served by
{Wg{wa{Wi'{ws{Wh{wa{Wi{wn{x.  They carry trays stacked with {Ws{wi{Dlv{we{Wr{x bowls fit for a palace. 
Yet, your meal is eaten from {ypo{wtte{yry{x with a {Bblue{x-striped glaze.  {WWhite{x tiles
have been set into stone for a table, forcing guests to eat with their heads
together.  This spoke-like arrangement makes it easy for {Wg{wa{Wi{x'{ws{Wh{wa{Wi{wn{x to slip
between the guests to serve their meals and {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x are accustomed to this
position anyway, they eat stretched out on the floor in whatever position is
most comfortable to them.

center of the far wall, there is a large {Do{wv{Den{x, blazing with a warm {Rf{Yi{rr{Re{x.  On
its surface, a crumbly, coarse {Yyellow{x bread is being baked.  Around the
oven, small {ys{wt{Do{wn{ye{x tables are being used to prepare bright {rr{Re{rd{x beans mixed
with {gg{Gree{gn{x ones called zemai and a dish of bright {Yyellow{x kernels and bits of
pulpy {rr{Re{rd{x called t'mat.  The air is thick with the spicy scent of peppers

and inlaid with {Wi{Yv{Wory{x, vases laced with {Wpe{war{Wls{x and {Wporcelain{x and {yg{Yol{yd{x music

is perhaps the grandest in the Hold, supporting rows and rows of tiered
{gp{Glant{gs{x, blooming in the desert {Ys{Wu{Yn{x.  The most abundant food that grows here
is kardon.  It is a sweet, bulbous fruit with a tough, {ggr{Geeni{gsh{x skin.  It
grows on the leafless, spiny {ypl{Gan{yts{x that are blooming in abundance on the
north side of the garden.  At least twice a day, a gai'shain must come up
here with a large pot of {Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{x and individually nourish each plant to
protect it from withering beneath the {Ys{Wu{Yn{x's harsh rays.

This room, in the Wise Ones' Roof, is probably the most valuable in the
Hold.  It is where all of the {Db{wo{Wo{wk{Ds{x are stored that do not belong to
individual families.  The {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x seek after books so avidly because none are
manufactured in the Three-fold Land.  When peddlers bring them into the
Hold, they are the first things to be sold.  Through these books, the {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x
have some knowledge of the lands and history to the east.  There are many

covered with one large {bt{Ba{Dp{wes{Dt{Br{by{x decorating the floor.  It's soft and thick
and woven with a large, overlapping {bsq{Bua{bre{x pattern.  Arched niches are

This room is reserved for the Head Wise One, decorated with all of her
favorite possessions.  Most of the objects here are {ytr{Yea{Ws{Yur{yes{x given as gifts
or taken as a fifth from Aiel raids.  Statuettes and {Ws{wp{Wa{wr{Wk{wl{Wi{wn{Wg{x gems are
placed in tiled niches that display them proudly, and large bowls and other
trinkets too large to be placed in the nooks are propped on small, {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x

{yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x children are sent here daily to work with the Wise Ones.  They learn
reading, writing, and arithmetic as well as survival and combat skills. 
Teaching also focuses on the intricacies of ji'e'toh and politics.  Most of
the children attend class in the morning so that they can hurry down to the
practice yards after lessons to spar.  Some of the less driven children
chose to sneak away to the {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x gardens after class to play instead of
learning warrior skills.

This is the room that all Wise One apprentice's hate to see.  And,
unfortunately, it is quite easy to be sent here.  Traditionally, each Wise
One only has one apprentice that she works with.  If her trainee cannot
repeat back a lecture after one hearing, she is punished.  Punishments
include digging holes and filling them back up with {ye{wa{Dr{yth{x again, burying
{Da{ws{Dhes{x with a {Ds{wp{Wo{wo{Dn{x and piling {yr{wo{Dc{yks{x.  The futility of these tasks underlines
that they are punishments.  This room is conducive to these tasks.  The

Ones' roof, niches in the walls, lined with tile {Bm{Co{Gs{Wi{Ga{Cc{Bs{x, hold treasures
taken from beyond the Dragonwall.  Each item displayed is very expensive and
well-crafted from the finest material.  As they pass one another in the
hall, the Maidens flash hand gestures.  It is a language they have developed
to make communication easier among their society.  Often times, they use
their hands to tell one another about how out of place the {Wga{wi'{Wsh{wa{Win{x looks,
being the only male allowed in this roof.

might be hurt when the warriors decide to duel.  Also, some of the very few
wild {gg{Gree{gn{x plants in the Hold bloom here, protected from the sun that would
burn their leaves and turn them {ybrown{x.  The warriors order {Wg{wa{Wi{x'{Ws{wh{Wa{wi{Wn{x to

A Nursery~
This baby's nursery is painted a pale {Mpink{x color.  Pictures of her family
decorate the walls, along with a few shelves that are laden with stuffed
toys.  A crib is in the corner of the room.  It is quite simple looking and
its polish still shines like it isn't often used.  Really, the only thing
interesting about this room is the "{Gsuck, suck, suck{x" sounds that emanate
from the baby's mouth.

A Kitchen~
A modern day kitchen {Ws{wp{Wa{wr{Wk{wl{We{ws{x from floor to ceiling.  Not even a {ycrumb{x
has been left on the ground.  All of the appliances have been polished and
pushed into their appropriate places on the counter top and the cleaning
supplies have been neatly tucked away under the sink.  A {yc{Dh{yo{Dc{yo{Dl{ya{Dt{ye{x cake is
baking in the oven.  It fills the kitchen with an aroma that makes your
mouth water.

A School Room~
A {Dch{Wal{Dkboard{x decorates the wall at the front of this room.  Words,
letters and homework assignments have been scrolled on its surface.  There
is one large {ydesk{x in the front of the classroom, followed by rows of smaller
desks that lead to the back.  A few {Rb{Wo{wo{Rks{x rest on top of the desks, or on
shelves built into the walls.  Through the windows on the north wall, you
can see the playground.  The swings rock back and forth in the breeze.

A Smithy's Repair Room~
The repair room of the {Dblack{wsm{Wi{wth{x's roof has been carved into the canyon
wall and provides {Dshade{x in the morning hours so that the master craftsman
can work.  Even with the protection of the canyon walls it is still quite
hot in here because of the forges used to heat the {Dm{we{Wt{wa{Dl{x.  To help with the
heat, the room is well-ventilated, also keeping the smithy safe from fumes. 
Precious {Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{x fills several small, covered tanks used for quenching.  They
are filled by {Wg{wa{Wi{x'{ws{Wh{wa{Wi{wn{x everyday so that work can be continued in the
morning.  Today, it looks as if the blacksmith's {Da{wnv{Dil{x is busy repairing the
weapons that {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x warriors have broken in the practice yard.

The Back Room of the Blacksmith's Shop~
This smaller room, built off the main section of the {Dblack{wsm{Wi{wth{x's roof,
is used for practice and tinkering.  Many oddly shaped pieces of {Dm{we{Wt{wa{Dl{x are
scattered on the floor, looking like they still have yet to take on their
natural shape.  Aside from the metal, sheep's {yd{wu{Dn{yg{x is piled against the
walls to fuel the flames.  A few of the blacksmith's {Dt{woo{Dls{x hang from hooks
bolted into the wall.  If they aren't there, the {Dblack{wsm{Wi{wth{x must be using
them because he is always careful to put his things away.

A Weaponsmith~
The weapon smith makes his shop in one of the back rooms of the roof.  It
is rather {Ddark{x and lonely here, but the craftsman prefers it this way.  He
gets more work done.  The only light in this room comes from the small {Do{wv{We{Dn{x
in the corner of the room that is fueled by sheep {ymanure{x.  There are {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x
tables to make work easier, but they are all covered with scraps of metal,
pieces of {ywood{x, sticks and large stones.  Remnants of whittling cover the
floor.  They mix with {yd{wi{Dr{yt{x and other debris and because the weapon smith is
so busy, he doesn't have time to clean them up.

A Small Closet~
This small room is attached to the Head Wise One's chambers and is used
to store things that she does not want everyone to see.  There are no
windows carved into the walls, nor are there any candles to light the room. 
It is very hard to get around this small chamber, unless you know where you
are going or what you are looking for.

A Thieve's Hideout~
It is almost impossible to believe that a thieves' hideout would exist
among the {yA{Yi{ye{Yl{x, especially given their harsh treatment for those caught
stealing.  However, these thieves appear to be doing quite well for
themselves.  Precious {Ds{wt{Won{we{Ds{x, {rg{Rem{rs{x, and jewelry sit atop shelves on the
walls.  Of most value is the large barrel which is filled to overflowing
with {Cw{ca{Ct{ce{Cr{x, a commodity more precious than {yg{Yol{yd{x in these dry lands.

A Sleeping Chamber~
It is here that the thieve's of Shaido Hold rest when they are weary and
no other shelter offers itself.  Many {ywooden{x trunks line the wall with
sleeping {cbl{Can{cke{Cts{x set on top of them.  Each trunk is closed and locked, thus
providing some sense of security for the goods contained inside, although,
how much security can exist in a hideout for professional thieves?

A Small Kitchen~
The {ma{Mr{mo{Mm{ma{x of baking fills the air, although, you aren't quite sure what
is cooking.  The smell isn't offensive but it doesn't exactly cause your
mouth to salivate either.  A large {rf{Ri{Yr{We{Yp{Ri{rt{x takes up the majority of one
wall, with a large {Dca{wldr{Don{x hanging over it.  Whatever is inside of it
bubbles frantically.  Along another wall, sacks of {yfood{x, spoils from
robberies, have been dropped and will be emptied during the next meal.

A Pet Roof~
This room, far above the floor of the Hold, is rather difficult to find
unless you know where it is.  Even from the ledge that passes to the west,
it is very difficult to see.  The outer walls swirl and bend, creating a
small crevice that conceals the door to this roof, {yca{Dm{wou{yfl{Dag{yi{wng{x the fact
that anything is even here.  This shop, however, is a fun find.  It is
filled will all kinds of curious {yan{Dim{wa{yl{Ds{x that inhabit the desert.  They all
seem very tame, mainly because none of them are caged and they all interact
well with one another.  The room has a curious odor...  A mix of rotting
{yf{Ro{Do{yd{x that appeals to these creatures, feces and the animals themselves.  The
storekeeper, however, doesn't seem to mind.  He clearly loves animals!

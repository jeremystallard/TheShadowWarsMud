This is a dark and sinister area of mainly {gd{ye{gc{yi{gd{yu{go{yu{gs{x {gw{Goo{gdl{Gan{gd{x that
spreads out in almost every direction.  The fertile {ys{Doi{yl{x within this area
makes the conditions almost perfect for immense amounts of {Gveg{getat{Gion{x
growing in this {gw{Goo{gd{x.  There is thick leafy green {gund{Gergro{gwth{x throughout
this area of the {gw{Goo{gd{x that almost completely obscures the rocky ground
beneath it.  Also hidden below {gund{Gergro{gwth{x is a tangled maze of gnarled old
{gt{Gr{ge{Ge{x {yr{wo{yo{wt{ys{x that protrude from the surface of the {ye{Da{wr{Dt{yh{x and make traversing

{gD{Gens{ge W{Goo{gdl{Gan{gd{x~
This dark and ancient {gw{Goo{gdl{Gan{gd{x sprawls out in almost every direction. 
The density of the {Gveg{getat{Gion{x is so great that it is difficult to see any
definite route through the twisted mass of {gf{Gl{Yo{Gr{ga{x.  A few sweetgum {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x have
managed to find niches within in this tightly packed {gw{Goo{gd{x but the area is
dominated by majestic oak {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x that tower over a thick and tangled mess of
thorny {gb{Gu{gsh{Ge{gs{x, {yb{mr{yambl{me{ys{x and {gv{Gi{Yn{Ge{gs{x.  The ground beneath the {gund{Gergro{gwth{x is
littered with a combination of rotting {Gveg{getat{Gion{x, {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{x {yr{wo{yo{wt{ys{x and rocks
which makes traveling through this area a difficult and treacherous task.

majority of the {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x within this {gw{Goo{gd{x are {gd{ye{gc{yi{gd{yu{go{yu{gs{x but there are one or
two {geve{crgre{gens{x to be seen dotted amongst the rest of the {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x.  The land
appears to be very fertile for there is an immense amount of leafy {gb{Gu{gsh{Ge{gs{x
growing in this area making it difficult to see whether there are any
undemanding routes and {ytr{Dai{yls{x through this {gw{Goo{gdl{Gan{gd{x.  The layer of rotting
{Gveg{getat{Gion{x lies on top of stony {ys{Doi{yl{x and with the addition of {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{x {yr{wo{yo{wt{ys{x
protruding through the surface of the ground make the process of traveling
through this area a hazardous task.

This is a dark and creepy area of {gf{Gores{gt{x that extends out in all
directions.  There is a variety of {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x growing in this vicinity, the
majority of them are ancient {gd{ye{gc{yi{gd{yu{go{yu{gs{x {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x but a few {geve{crgre{gens{x can also
be seen.  Densely growing {yb{mr{yambl{me{ys{x and {gb{Gu{gsh{Ge{gs{x partially obscures the stony
yet marshy ground in which they grow.  To the north the ground steeply
inclines downward although the way ahead is hidden by the thick {gund{Gergro{gwth{x
and the only sign of what lies ahead is the faint sound of running {cw{Ca{Wt{Ce{cr{x. 
Also concealed beneath {gund{Gergro{gwth{x are twisted {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{x {yr{wo{yo{wt{ys{x that protrude from
the surface of the {ye{Da{wr{Dt{yh{x and make passing through this area a problem.

This is a particularly dark and ominous section of {gw{Goo{gdl{Gan{gd{x.  This
section of the {gf{Gores{gt{x is clearly dominated by young yet huge and towering
pine {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x whose interlacing canopies almost totally obscure the {Cs{Wk{Cy{x above. 
Deep green {gi{Gv{gy{x has taken a hold of much of the {gf{Gores{gt{x with many of the older
{gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x have been caught in the {gv{Gi{Yn{Ge{gs{x' choking grasps.  In between the {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x

{yr{wo{yo{wt{ys{x that jut out from the {gf{Gores{gt{x floor.  Beneath the layer of rotting
{Gveg{getat{Gion{x that covers much of the {gf{Gores{gt{x floor, there is a distinct change
in the type of {ys{Doi{yl{x to a more compact and relatively less fertile terrain;
there may have once been a {ytr{Da{yil{x or a {yr{Doa{yd{x leading through this area.

thick mushy layer of rotting {Gveg{getat{Gion{x is the {ys{Doi{yl{x, a stony yet soft ground

This is a dark and gloomy area of a large {gf{Gores{gt{x that spreads out in
almost every direction.  There is a wide variety of {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x growing in this
vicinity, most of them are {gd{ye{gc{yi{gd{yu{go{yu{gs{x {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x but a few {geve{crgre{gens{x are also
visible.  Rampant {gi{Gv{gy{x has taken a hold of much of this area with many of the
elder {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x caught in the {gv{Gi{Yn{Ge{gs{x' choking grasps.  Densely growing {gb{Gu{gsh{Ge{gs{x
partially conceal the stony yet marshy ground in which they grow as well as
a multitude of twisted {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{x {yr{wo{yo{wt{ys{x that protrude from the ground and make
crossing this area a difficult process.

Most of the {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x that grow in this particular section of the {gw{Good{gs{x are
tall pine {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x whose intertwining canopies almost completely block out the
{Cs{Wk{Cy{x above and shroud the {gf{Gores{gt{x floor in darkness.  A thick blanket of leafy
green {gund{Gergro{gwth{x and decomposing {Gveg{getat{Gion{x partly covers the soft muddy
ground beneath it.  There are twisted masses of {yb{mr{yambl{me{ys{x that have grown so
thickly and widespread in this part of the {gf{Gores{gt{x that they are virtually
impenetrable.  Also in this area are several varieties colorful {yf{Yung{yi{x
dwelling in the {Ds{wh{Da{wd{Do{ww{Ds{x of the {gf{Gores{gt{x; the majority of them appear to be
poisonous {rt{Roa{Yd{Wst{Yo{Rol{rs{x.

This is a particularly dark and dismal section of {gf{Gores{gt{x.  There does not
seem to be any visible {ytr{Dai{yls{x through the {gf{Gores{gt{x at this point; the dense
{gf{Gl{Yo{Gr{ga{x that grows here almost completely obscures both the ground and what
lies ahead.  Tall, ancient {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x overlook the dense clumps of leafy {gb{Gr{ga{Gc{gk{Ge{gn{x;
the {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x' gnarled limbs are reminiscent of claws trying to reach out and
ensnare unsuspecting victims.  There are {yb{mr{yambl{me{ys{x that have grown so thickly
and widespread in this part of the {gf{Gores{gt{x that they are practically
impossible to pass.

This is a small grassy clearing located somewhere within a dark and
gloomy {gf{Gores{gt{x.  Small clusters of thistles, dandelions and other wild plants
have sprouted up within clearing in a haphazard manner.  The perimeter of

are in turn encircled by grand, lofty {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x.  The leafy {Gveg{getat{Gion{x growing

A densely packed {gf{Gores{gt{x gives way to a large abandoned {cv{wil{Wl{wag{ce{x.  Numerous
{Db{wui{Wldi{wng{Ds{x of varying sizes that have been constructed from rounded river
{Ws{wt{Don{we{Ws{x can be seen amongst the rampant {Gveg{getat{Gion{x.  Some of the {Db{wui{Wldi{wng{Ds{x
have their thatched roofs relatively intact although they are blackened due
to discoloration from rotting.  The majority of the {Db{wui{Wldi{wng{Ds{x' roofs are not
visible; they have probably caved-in under their own weight a long time ago.
{gT{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x that are much younger than the ones that grow in the surrounding
{gw{Goo{gdl{Gan{gd{x have sprouted up in between the {Db{wui{Wldi{wng{Ds{x and are an indication to
how long this {cs{wet{Wt{wle{Wm{wen{ct{x had been abandoned.  A wide {yt{Dr{wa{Dc{yk{x made of hard

This is a narrow mud {yt{Dr{wa{Dc{yk{x that runs east/west through a large, yet
deserted {cv{wil{Wl{wag{ce{x.  The {yr{Doa{yd{x is split in two by a shallow {cs{Ctrea{cm{x; the large

the {cw{Cat{cer{Cwa{cy{x was much broader and faster flowing in the past.  There was
once a {yw{Do{yod{De{yn{x {yb{Dr{yid{Dg{ye{x spanning the {cw{Cat{cer{Cwa{cy{x but now only the gray {Ws{wt{Do{wn{We{x

ago; {gw{Ge{Ye{Gd{gs{x and {yb{mr{yambl{me{ys{x are growing in abundance and taken over much of the
area.  A few derelict structures can be seen from this point; the {Dm{was{Wo{wnr{Dy{x of
the {Db{wui{Wldi{wng{Ds{x appears to be undamaged but much of the {ywo{Do{ydw{Do{yrk{x, roofing and
window panes are either missing or broken.  One particularly large {Db{wui{Wld{win{Dg{x
on the south side of the {ys{Dt{wre{De{yt{x stands out from the all of the others; it
may once have been a tavern or an inn.

{mAn Abandoned Inn{x~
This large oblong room once served as common room to an inn or tavern. 
All that remains is the bar, a wide {Wf{wire{Dp{wlac{We{x and a few items of furniture
covered in {Wco{wb{Ww{we{Wbs{x.  {DM{was{Wo{wnr{Dy{x which has become loose over time and fallen out
has left large gaping {Dholes{x in the walls.  Swirling clouds of {Dd{wus{Dt{x hang in
the air, creating random yet intricate patterns within the patches of {Ds{wh{Da{wd{Do{ww{x

decaying away, revealing the {yl{Da{ythi{Dn{yg{x behind it.  There also appears to be
only two exits from this room; each one is marked by a door that hangs

{rA Hallway{x~
This is a short and particularly plain corridor located within a deserted
inn.  The air within this area feels damp and many of the {yw{Do{yod{De{yn{x floorboards
are showing signs of rotting.  Scattered across the floor is debris; a large
amount of it comes from the ceiling above where the {Wp{wl{Wa{ws{Wt{we{Wr{x has rotted away
to reveal the {yt{Di{ymb{De{yr{x {yl{Da{ythi{Dn{yg{x behind it.  There are also many {Dho{Dles{x along the
wall of the corridor where the {Dm{was{Wo{wnr{Dy{x has become loose over time and fallen
out.  There are several doorways along the hallway although some of the
rickety {yw{Do{yod{De{yn{x doors are only just left hanging upon their {rr{yu{Ds{yt{ry{x hinges.

{rA Deserted Common Room{x~
This is a rather small and dingy common room located within a deserted
inn.  The air within this area feels clammy and many of the damp {yw{Do{yod{De{yn{x
floorboards are starting to rot.  Debris litters the floor of the common
room; the majority of it originates from the ceiling where the {Wp{wl{Wa{ws{Wt{we{Wr{x has
rotted away to reveal the {yt{Di{ymb{De{yr{x {yl{Da{ythi{Dn{yg{x behind it.  The {Dbr{wic{Wk{wwo{Drk{x has
become loose over time and fallen out in places, leaving large gaping {Dho{Dles{x
in the walls.  Very little in this room has survived over the years from
neglect and the hands of looters; only the bar, the {Wf{wire{Dp{wlac{We{x and a few
items of furniture remain.  There are several doorways leading out of the
common room although some of the rickety {yw{Do{yod{De{yn{x doors are barely hanging
upon their {rr{yu{Ds{yt{ry{x hinges.

{rAn Overgrown Yard{x~
This is a large open area of ground that has virtually been taken over by
{gw{Ge{Ye{Gd{gs{x.  The area looks like it was used as a yard to store carts and wagons;
although the yard looks like it has been abandoned for many years some of
the original wheel tracks lie preserved within the hard packed ground.  The
area is overlooked along its borders by young {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x and shrubs except for
its southern border where a large cube shaped {Db{wui{Wld{win{Dg{x stands.

{BA Cellar{x~
This is a dark and dank cellar whose gray {Ws{wt{Do{wn{We{x walls feel unusually
cold.  The {Ws{wt{Do{wn{We{x tiled floor also appears to be wet; the moisture and dirt
on the floor have made a slimy concoction that is slippery underfoot. 
Despite the clammy conditions within cellar, the room is currently in use to
store {yw{Do{yod{De{yn{x crates, chests and barrels.  A cold draft seems to come through
the trapdoor in the ceiling and flow down the steep {yw{Do{yod{De{yn{x steps, filling
the area with an icy chill.

The exterior of this {Wh{wo{Dus{We{x is in such a poor state of repair that it
looks like it has been abandoned.  Although the majority of the rooms in the
{Wh{wo{Dus{We{x remain relatively untouched, the kitchen in this large abode looks
like it is currently in use.  Someone's bedding has been stuffed into one
corner of the room whilst the cupboards and drawers are crammed to bursting
point with what appears to be junk.  The kitchen table has not escaped the
onslaught of junk; numerous mechanical parts and tools lay strewn across the
tabletop.

one of the ovens is even being used as a nest by some opportunistic {gw{Goo{gdl{Gan{gd{x

furniture and other possessions that were in the living quarters at the back

The North Road~
The North Road is little more than a wide {ymuddy track{x that cuts through
the far-west region of Andor known as the Two Rivers.  The land is a
patchwork of {gf{yi{gel{yd{gs{x, {go{Grchard{gs{x and {gp{Ga{gs{Gtu{gr{Ge{gs{x that are bordered by {gforests{x and
towered over by the sharp gray peaks of the Mountains of Mist that lie due
west.  To the south lies Emond's Field, one of the Two Rivers quaint
villages.

The North Road~
The wide {ydirt thoroughfare{x that is commonly known as the North Road
passes a collection of stout frame houses that surround a large {gv{Gi{gl{Gl{ga{Gg{ge
g{Gr{ge{Ge{gn{x, a particularly squat construction sits on the east side of this road.
The {gv{Gi{gl{Gl{ga{Gg{ge g{Gr{ge{Ge{gn{x itself is particularly unusual as it is divided into two
by a gushing {cs{Ct{Wre{Ca{cm{x that flows eastward under a series of {yw{Do{yod{De{yn b{Dr{yidg{De{ys{x.

lies due south of this point, the area is bisected by a surging {cs{Ct{Wre{Ca{cm{x.  A
neat row of thatched buildings border the opposite side of the road, the
majority of them are cottages.  The street joins a much wider thoroughfare
to the east known as the North Road.

The bridge links two muddy roads, to the north is the North Road whilst to
the south is the Old Road.  This point gives an excellent view of the large
grassy area to the west known as the Green and the hodgepodge of thatched
cottages built around it.

point.  The ground to the east of becomes too soft and boggy to support the
weight of {Dw{yagon{Ds{x as the Winespring Water splits into smaller {cw{Cat{Werw{Cay{cs{x that
feed both the Waterwood and the Mire.  To the west the land becomes much
firmer and {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x give way to clusters of farms.

A Narrow Street~
This is a long yet narrow road street that leads around Emond's Field's
{gv{Gi{gl{Gl{ga{Gg{ge g{Gr{ge{Ge{gn{x.  A fierce gushing {cs{Ct{Wre{Ca{cm{x can be seen from this point,
emerging from a low {Dr{wo{Wc{wk o{Dut{wc{Wr{wo{Dp{x and dividing the grassy area in half.  The
area is overlooked by stout frame cottages that have steeply sloped thatched
roofs.  This street joins a much wider thoroughfare to the south known as
Quarry Road.

The Green~
The Green lies at the heart of the little village of Emond's Field.  It
is a big expanse of grassy land bordered by thatched stout frame cottages. 
A rapid flowing {cs{Ct{Wre{Ca{cm{x known as the Winespring Water emerges from a low {Dr{wo{Wc{wk
o{Dut{wc{Wr{wo{Dp{x on the west side of the {gv{Gi{gl{Gl{ga{Gg{ge g{Gr{ge{Ge{gn{x, dividing the area into two. 
The Green is used as a gathering place for special occasions such as
festivals as well as a place for the children to play or the locals to
indulge in a game of bowls.

Outside The Winespring Inn~
The Winespring Inn is the largest building of the village however unlike
the other buildings of Emond's Field, the inn has twelve chimneys and it has
been roofed with {rred tiles{x.  The first floor of the building is made from
{Dr{wi{Wv{we{Dr{w r{Wo{wc{Dk{x but the inn's {Df{wo{Wu{wn{Dd{wa{Dt{wi{Wo{wn{Ds{x are of older stone that once came from
the mountains.  The {Df{wo{Wu{wn{Dda{wt{Wi{wo{Dn{x continues south of the inn, appearing to be
the remains of a much older and larger structure.  The second floor of the
building has been constructed from timber and juts out over the first floor
all the way around.

The common room of the Winespring Inn is warm and cozy place despite its
walls being created out of {Dr{wi{Wv{we{Dr{w r{Wo{wc{Dk{x.  The room is relatively large and has
been built with a tall {Df{wi{Wr{we{Dp{wl{Wa{wc{De{x that is almost half the length of room.  A
steep {ys{Dt{ya{Di{yr{Dc{ya{Ds{ye{x leads to the second floor where the guest rooms and the
innkeeper's quarters lie whilst on the north side of the room is a door
leading into a short hallway.  The only other exit from the common room is a
sturdy door on the west side.

Like the rest of the rooms that lie on the first floor of this building,
the walls of this hallway have been constructed form {Dr{wi{Wv{we{Dr{w r{Wo{wc{Dk{x.  There are
two doorways along this hallway, the one to the south leads into the common
room whilst the one on the east side of the corridor leads into the inn's
kitchen.  A {Dh{wo{Wo{Dk{x has been fixed into the wall next to the kitchen door; the
{Ds{wo{Do{wt{Dy m{wa{Dr{wk{Ds{x around it suggest that a lamp was once hung here.  A closer
examination of the floor below the {Dh{wo{Wo{Dk{x reveals a {yt{Dr{yapdo{Do{yr{x which probably
leads into a cellar.

{Di{wro{Dn st{wov{Des{x have been built into the kitchen as well as numerous cupboards,
drawers and worktops.  A faint aroma of {Dt{ya{Db{ya{Dc{x and {yale{x drifts in through the
door on the west side of the room whilst a cool {Cd{Wr{Ca{Wu{Cg{Wh{Ct{x flows through a gap
underneath the door on the south side of the kitchen; a window next to the
southern exit looks out over a thatched stable and a yard.

{gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x grow in abundance in this area as well as thick tangles of {yb{gra{ymb{gle{ys{x
and {gv{Gi{Wn{Ge{gs{x.  A mulch of oak leaves litters the ground as well as a scattering
of squirrel-chewed {ga{Dc{yor{Dn{gs{x.  One tree in this area stands out from the rest
in this area, an oak that is almost completely cleaved into two, the two
halves of its trunk lean apart like a fork.  The inside surface of the tree
is black and hardened like iron.

but little of the path remains now.  Only the tall {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x that once flanked

the way passable.  There are no other buildings in view from this point; the
derelict house stands alone amongst the vegetation.

The thick vegetation has almost claimed what is left of the Old

drunkenly.  The walls are choked with {gv{Gi{Wn{Ge{gs{x and {yb{gr{Dia{gr{ys{x that snake their way
across the surface of the masonry.  {gV{Gi{Wn{Ge{gs{x also cover part of the original
thatching which still remains but half of the house's rooms are open to the

A Stone Cellar~
The Winespring Inn's cellar is a stone-walled room that was probably part
of a much bigger building.  Wooden racks fixed along the walls and the floor
hold {yc{Da{ys{Dk{ys{x of {yb{Yr{yan{Yd{yy{x and {yc{Yi{yd{Ye{yr{x as well as larger {yb{Da{yrre{Dl{ys{x of {yale{x and {mw{Min{me{x. 
Many of the {mw{Min{me{x {yb{Da{yrre{Dl{ys{x are marked with their year of purchase, what
peddler brought them and in which city they were made but the {yale{x and {yb{Yr{yan{Yd{yy{x
appears to be made on the Two Rivers farms or by the innkeeper.  There
appears to be only one exit from this room, a steep {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De s{wta{Wirc{was{De{x that

large gray stone {Df{wi{Wr{we{Dp{wl{Wa{wc{De{x.  The huge {Dk{we{Dtt{wl{De{x that hangs over the fire is
probably used to heat the water for the {Dt{wi{Wn b{wat{Dh{x that sits in the corner of
the room.  The back room is also the home to numerous {ycupboards{x, {ycabinets{x
and {ys{Dh{yelv{De{ys{x that are used to store items varying from {cblankets{x and {Wbed linen{x
to cleaning utensils.

The Blacksmith's House~
Like a lot of the houses in Emond's Field, this one has been expanded
over time to accommodate several generations beneath one thatched roof with
its many extensions built into both floors of the building.  The main focal
point of the building is the front room with its enormous gray stone
{Df{wi{Wr{we{Dp{wl{Wa{wc{De{x and the comfortable {ma{Mrm{mcha{Mir{ms{x that surround it.  At the other end

all of the blacksmith's tools kept safe in their respective {yr{Da{yc{Dk{ys{x, {yc{Du{ypboar{Dd{ys{x
or {yd{Dr{yawe{Dr{ys{x.  At the west side of the workshop is the {Df{wo{Wr{wg{De{x with a small

The back room of the Old Sickhouse is almost identical to the front room
with its warped walls that are almost entirely covered with tangles of {gv{Gi{Wn{Ge{gs{x
and {yb{gr{Dia{gr{ys{x.  The thatched roof is missing over this room leaving this area
open to the elements.  Birds roosting in what is left of the thatch can be
seen from this point as well as a badger's den dug underneath the back
steps.  The Westwood and its tangle of {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x, {yb{gra{ymb{gle{ys{x and {gv{Gi{Wn{Ge{gs{x closes in
on the house from all directions making it impossible to venture deeper into
the woods from this point.

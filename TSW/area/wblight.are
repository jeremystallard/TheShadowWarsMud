The Blight Border~
Even without the {DBo{wrd{Werst{won{Des{x marking the border the edge of the Blight's
border is both plainly visible and felt.  The green lands of the south
abruptly give way to diseased and twisted landscapes corrupted by the Dark
One.  Regardless of the time of year the air here is has an {Ci{Wc{Cy{x bite to it,
a distinct difference to the tales of almost unbearable {rh{Rea{rt{x and humidity of

This was once a grand road but all that remains now of the thoroughfare
are a few worn paving slabs embedded in the {ydirt{x.  The view to the south is
blocked by the steep hill around which this road winds whilst to the north
is a vast mountain range whose jagged peaks resemble broken teeth.  Almost
everything that can be seen from this point has been touched by the Dark
One's corruption, from the {Dd{yea{Dd t{yree{Ds{x that still stand upon the hillside to
the clumps of brown grass although the effects become more apparent
westwards along the road.

This is vast plateau surrounded by hilly land that stretches out almost

this area is now piles of fallen tree trunks, stripped bare of limbs and

A Broken Bridge~
This is the southern side of a {rb{Dr{wok{De{rn b{Dr{wid{Dg{re{x that once crossed a great
river.  All that remains of the waterway is a slow moving stream tainted
with brown sludge from decaying vegetation.  The bridge's stone abutments
have been worn down significantly that they could almost be mistaken for
natural rock formations apart from their reddish color that marks them out
from the local {Dg{wra{Dy r{woc{Dk{x.  To the north lies the other end of the bridge but
appears to be no way of reaching it from this point.

moving river looks like a thick goopy mixture of silt, rotting vegetative
matter and water making it impossible to see how deep the river really is.

The South Bank~
This is the southern embankment of a slow moving river.  There is a
strong stench of decaying vegetation in this area, both from the sludgy
brown river and the sickly yellow flora that has infested the {ymuddy slopes{x
flanking the waterway.  A {Dd{yea{Dd t{yre{De{x has fallen over across the river,
providing a precarious route over the murky river.  The remnants of a {rb{Dr{wid{Dg{re{x

its blight-riddled backdrop.

Although the river's current is slow, the agitated {Ds{wil{Dt{x and {yr{Do{ytti{Dn{yg d{De{ybr{Di{ys{x

This is the northern embankment of a slow moving river.  The stench of
rotting foliage is heightened by the warm and humid atmosphere around this

around the river bank but the river itself that is a thick brown soup of
{Ds{wil{Dt{x and decomposing plant life.  A {Dd{yea{Dd t{yre{De{x has fallen over across the
river, providing a wobbly way over the cloudy waterway.  The remnants of a

the bridge and the embankment but the lay of the land suggest that the water

agitated {Ds{wil{Dt{x and decaying plant matter.  Centuries seem to have taken their

A few towering trees have escaped the choking effects of the {Dv{yine{Ds{x that
proliferate through this area.  Despite the vines' domination over this area
no plant is unscathed from the effects of the Dark One.  There is no
greenery in sight in this jungle, just a tangled mass of shriveled yellowing
plants mottled with red and brown patches.  Even the {Df{rr{yu{ri{Dt{x growing upon the
trees is stunted and rotting whilst they hang.

Where the Sun Does Not Shine~
The tangled mass of {Dt{gree{Ds{x and {Dv{yine{Ds{x grow very densely in this area of the

within their domain.  A sickly sweet smell of decay comes from the trees
where branches laden with {Df{mr{ru{mi{Dt{x have succumbed to the Dark One's influence.

The blighted vegetation that suffocates this area has failed to prevail

The Rot Sets In...~
Part of the gray stone walls and the stone-tiled floors is all that is
left of this building.  Brown vines from the surrounding {Df{yores{Dt{x have covered
most of these ruins but a few stone surfaces remain visible.  There is a
stench of {Dd{we{Dc{wa{Dy{x in the air that is coming from the odd {rr{Re{rd b{Rerrie{rs{x growing
upon the {Dv{yine{Ds{x which are rotting where they hang.

A Glimpse of The Past~
The {Db{gli{ygh{gte{Dd j{gu{yng{gl{De{x gives way to the remains of an ancient road that
passes between the jagged dark gray stone remnants of buildings that were
probably shops or houses.  The road runs parallel to a tall {Dc{wit{Wy w{wal{Dl{x that
is in as equally a bad shape as the structures that it encircles.  The only
structure within this vicinity that looks stable is a {Dwa{wtc{Wht{wow{Der{x that was
built into the {Dc{wit{Wy w{wal{Dl{x down the east end of the road.

An Abandoned Watchtower~
A broken {Dar{wche{Wd do{worw{Day{x leads into this {Dwa{wtc{Wht{wow{Der{x, one of several
similar structures that probably existed on the boundaries of this city. 
The stone looks old and weathered from centuries of exposure to the elements
but there are some sheltered areas here that still bear the blackened {Dscorch
marks{x of a fire.  There was once a spiraling stone {Dst{wai{Wr{wca{Dse{x but it is now a
pile of rubble at the base of the tower leaving no safe route upwards to the
top.

A few shattered paving slabs are all that remains of a once grand avenue.
The area is choked up with gnarled trees and densely growing {yfoliage{x that
look sickly and stink of {Dd{we{Dc{wa{Dy{x.  The {yvegetation{x growing in this area fails
to hide the remnants of large {Dg{wra{Dy s{wton{De b{wuilding{Ds{x but there is very little
of these structures remaining to indicate what their original purposes were.

An Overgrown Avenue~
The {Db{gli{ygh{gte{Dd j{gu{yng{gl{De{x has failed to consume this once great city entirely. 
Broken paving slabs embedded deep in the earth mark out the path of what
used to be a wide avenue.  Tall {gtrees{x and bushy {yplants{x grow around and even
out of the empty shells of {Dg{wra{Dy s{wton{De b{wuilding{Ds{x that border the

The air within this hot and humid jungle of blighted plant life reeks
with the stench of {Dd{we{Dc{wa{Dy{x as {Df{gr{yu{gi{Dt{x rots while it still grows upon the trees

The hot and sticky atmosphere within this {Db{gli{Ggh{gte{Dd j{gu{Gng{gl{De{x seems to
enhance the putrid stench of {Dd{we{Dc{wa{Dy{x here.  Although there is more than a few
centuries' worth of plant life choking up the area there are clear signs
that this area was once inhabited by humans.  Despite the {DDark One's{x touch
apparent on the {Df{yl{go{yr{Da{x and {yf{waun{ya{x of this area, the remains of an ancient {yroad{x
it still visible as it cuts its way through the jungle.

Surrounded By Blight~
It may seem strange to some that a clearing could exist within a {Dj{gu{yng{gl{De{x
twisted by the {DDark One's{x touch.  The roughly ellipse-shaped area is
surrounded by {Dg{yn{warl{ye{Dd{x {Dt{yr{we{ye{Ds{x whose oddly-formed boughs look like they have
taken a life of their own as their reach out to snag anything that brushes
past them.  The clearing itself is a rocky area that appears to have been
part of an {Dex{wca{Wva{wtion s{Wi{wt{De{x or a place where rocky soil too poor to maintain
plant life has been dumped in a short but wide {Dheap{x.

A Deadly Viewpoint~
The land becomes increasingly rockier as it slopes downwards to the east,
making it more difficult for the {yblighted vegetation{x to take root.  Despite
the gradient of the land, the remnants of an ancient {yroadway{x slinking its
way cross-country are still visible.  The land to the south of the path
gives way to a sheer {Dr{wo{Wc{wky cl{Wi{wf{Df{x of approximately 100 feet in height; at the
bottom of the cliff is a river of {ybrown sludge{x bordered by yellowing
vegetation.

A Desolate Valley~
The Breaking of the World was responsible for many strange land
formations but there are not many as strange as this one.  The gray rocky
land has been concertinaed in a series of narrow valleys and jagged peaks
that are reminiscent of {Db{wr{Woken tee{wt{Dh{x.  This point overlooks a relatively
shallow valley that is divided in two by a {ybrown sludgy waterway{x.  A
relatively safe path down the side of the valley leads northwards, marked
out by a series of square {rs{Dt{wo{Dn{re s{Dl{wa{Db{rs{x embedded into the earth.

A Sharp Incline~
The remnants of an ancient {yroadway{x lead along the side of a sheer rocky
valley.  Despite this path been so steep, it is much safer to traverse than
straying from it.  No trees grow here, only the odd smattering of tiny
{ybrownish-yellow plants{x has managed to take root in this area.  Even the
river that lies at the bottom of the valley is void of any plant life
growing nearby it at this point; the {ysludgy brown waters{x are unable sustain
life in this wilderness.

An Ancient Road~
The lofty slopes of the {Dv{ya{wll{ye{Dy{x would have been almost impossible to scale
if it were not for this ancient road carved into its side.  The original
{rs{Dt{wo{Dn{re{x {rb{Dl{woc{Dk{rs{x used to pave the road still remain imbedded in the ground; the
deep ruts in the stonework hint that this route was used often and by heavy
wagons or carts despite the road's steep gradient.  A stench of {Dd{we{Dc{wa{Dy{x drifts
in from the east, the source of the odor is the {ysludgy {x{ybrown river{x that
flows along the bottom of the valley.

The Great Lord's Touch~
Here lies an ancient {yroad{x built from large slabs of {rs{Dt{wo{Dn{re{x follows the
edge of the {Dv{ya{wll{ye{Dy{x.  Humans may have once inhabited these lands but the
unnatural warmth and humidity of this area is a constant reminder that this
place is now deep within the Blight.  Very little {yv{ge{ygetati{go{yn{x has managed to
take root in this area, the rocky soil is not fertile enough even for the
{DDark {x{DOne's{x twisted creations.  A putrid stench of decay emanated from the
east, the source appears to be a slow flowing {cr{yive{cr{x whose waters look murky
and uninviting.

The ancient road that was built along the floor of the {Dv{ya{wll{ye{Dy{x changes
direction at this point as it follows the curvature of the {Dr{yo{wc{yk{Dy o{yut{wcr{yop{Ds{x. 
The air here is hot, sticky and filled with the putrid stench of {Dd{we{Dc{wa{Dy{x that
originates from the sludgy brown {cr{yive{cr{x that lies to the east.  There are
very few {gp{ylant{gs{x growing in this area; the land appears to be too poor and

Here lies the remains of an old paved {yroad {xthat meanders through a
predominately rocky area at the base of a deep {Dv{ya{wll{ye{Dy{x.  The road follows the
course of a {cr{yive{cr{x although the shape of the land suggests that the waterway
was much deeper than it is now.  {DO{ype{wnw{Work mi{wn{yin{Dg{x along this side of the
river has exposed much of the valley's strata but the worn and weathered
condition of the stone shows that this area was abandoned many centuries
ago.  The {rh{Ro{rt{x and {ch{Cumi{cd{x atmosphere within this valley clearly indicates that
this area is deep within the Blight despite the lack of vegetation growing
around here.

This is the east end of a large {Dex{yca{wva{yti{Don{x into the side of the {Dv{ya{wll{ye{Dy{x. 
The valley was originally v-shaped but the extensive {Dm{yin{win{Wg w{wo{yr{Dk{x in this
area has hollowed out the rocky cliff face and exposed the strata.  The
widespread weathering and erosion upon the cliff face suggest that this area
was {Dabandoned{x centuries ago.  To the south lies the remnants of a road and
beyond that a sluggish {cr{yive{cr{x that divides the valley neatly in two.

Years of {Do{ype{wnw{Work mi{wn{yin{Dg{x have cut away at this side of the {Dv{ya{wll{ye{Dy{x,
hollowing it out and exposing the valley's strata.  The days of mining have
long since gone as the valley and the lands that surround it have all been
claimed by the {DB{gl{Gig{gh{Dt{x.  The hot and sticky atmosphere filled with the putrid

must have happened here, the majority of the cliff's surface has smoothened
out somewhat by hundreds of years of {De{wr{Wosi{wo{Dn{x.  The {rh{Ro{rt{x and {ch{Cumi{cd{x atmosphere

signs that {Wlife{x once existed here.  The remnants of a {yroad{x follows the west
bank of the {cr{yive{cr{x that flows through the valley although now the river is a
now a sludgy brown soup that stinks of {Dd{yecayin{Dg v{yegetatio{Dn{x.  The rock
formations to the north changes abruptly, although the rocks are smoothed
with centuries of erosion, the layout of the land suggests that some form of
{Dqu{wa{Wrry{wi{Dng{x or {Wmi{wn{yin{Dg{x has happened there.

Something Of Value?~
The view from the {gr{ci{yverba{cn{gk{x is not the most pleasant of sights.  The
{Dv{ya{wll{ye{Dy{x is a vast area of desolate wasteland whose soil is too rocky and
unfertile to support anything but the hardiest of flora.  Despite the lack
of plants humans must have found something of value within the valley for
the remains of an ancient {yroad{x lay close by.

Saidin's Mark~
This spot beside the river provides a decent view of this v-shaped
{Dv{ya{wll{ye{Dy{x.  The dramatic folding of the rock formations show that much of the
valley's form was created during the Breaking of the World.  The {cr{yive{cr{x that
flows along here looks sluggish and the rotting vegetative matter floating
within it fills the air with a {Dp{ru{Rtr{ri{Dd s{rt{Ren{rc{Dh{x.  The {Dl{war{Wge ro{wck{Ds{x that litter
the ground indicate that the river was once much deeper and stronger than it
is now.  The valley is overshadowed by a mountain range to the northeast
whilst hills lie to the south and {Db{gli{ygh{gte{Dd j{gu{yng{gl{De{x to the west.

Crossing the River~
Perhaps in centuries past this area was a great {cr{yive{cr{x but now it is a
sluggish channel of rotting vegetable matter suspended in water.  The air is
strangely hotter and more humid towards the center of the waterway than it
is north the riverbanks.  The river is flanked on both sides by steeply
sloping cliffs that form a v-shaped {Dv{ya{wll{ye{Dy{x although some of the rock faces
appear to have been dug away further downstream.

have been hung, making the room appear to be even larger than it is. 
{DBlackwood{w tables sit next to the chairs, holding small pieces of carved
{Wivory{w.  A large {rr{Re{rd{w and {yg{Yol{yd{w carpet covers the floor.  The door to the south
opens into the bedroom, while the one to the north leads to the corridor.

The Dungeons - Lower Level~
The plain {yl{Yamp{ys{w that hang beside the large, sturdy, steel-banded {yd{Do{yo{Dr{ys{w make
{Dshadows{w dance across the walls.  The smooth stones of the floor have been
worn even smoother in the very center of the hallway, leading between two of
the cells of the dungeon.  Despite all efforts, there is always at least a
thin layer of {Ddust{w covering everything.

The Entry Hall~
The entry hall into the {YSun{w Palace of {cC{Ca{Yi{Wrh{Yi{Ce{cn{w is very large.  Thick,
square columns made of a dark {Dm{ba{Drb{bl{De{w hold up the square-vaulted ceiling,
which is ten paces high.  The golden {yc{Yornice{ys{w which run along the edge of
the ceiling depict large rising {Ysuns{w.  Friezes have been carved into the
walls below the cornices, depicting great Cairhienin triumphs.  The floor is
tiled with alternating dark {bbl{Bu{be{w and {yg{Yol{yd{w tiles.

the later parts of the day.  Spread out below is the eastern part of

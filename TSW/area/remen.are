brightly dressed man sailor~
a {bs{Bailo{br{x~
A {bb{Brightl{by d{Bresse{bd m{Ba{bn{x strolls around the docks.
~
This man is one of the many sailors that can be seen working with the
boats moored at the docks of Remen.  By his appearance this man is clearly
Altaran in origin and probably from the south.  His dark hair and eyes are a
striking contrast to the paler inhabitants of the town.  Garbed in brightly
colored yet loose working clothes, this man is a colorful sight to behold as
he strolls around the docks in a rolling gait.

dagger.  Worn over his plain gray woolen tunic this man wears a long leather
vest that carries a strange mark, perhaps that of the guild he belongs to.

~
This is a burly man with short black hair and dark brown eyes.  At a
first glance the clothing that this man wears seems very typical of the
style worn by most of this town's inhabitants although the long vest he
wears is made of leather.  The belt he wears is also unusual as is it made
with loops that are used to hold various implements that seem to be tools of
carpentry.

~
At first this young man does not appear to be out of the ordinary as he
wanders the streets, looking bored.  Dressed in plain woolen clothing cut in
an Altaran style, this man looks like he is either one of the citizens of
the town or perhaps from one of the villages nearby.  There is something
suspicious about the way he more than occasionally bumps into random members
of the crowd, he seems to sharp of eye as he watches the crowds to be
clumsy.

for his protection.

This mean-looking man is probably a mercenary from Altara by his attire. 
His clothing is made from finely woven cloth and wool and looks like it is
Altaran by its style.  The long vest that this man wears is as brightly
colored as any Tinker's could be.  The thing that distinguishes this man as
a mercenary is that is that he seems to be carrying more weapons about his
person than the average citizen.

appearance and style of clothing seem to indicate that this man is from
Murandy.  The dark colored knee length coat that this man wears is open just
enough to reveal that this man is armed and is probably a guard of some
sort.

This woman appears to be one of the citizens of Remen.  Her style of
dress is typical of this region; she wears a pale dress with a deep yet
narrow neckline.  The woman's skirt has been gathered up to one knee to
reveal the colorful petticoat beneath.  Around this woman's waist is a belt
in which is sheathed a curved knife, the type that Altarans use for dueling.
This woman's jewelry looks cheap, much of the "gems" used appear to be
nothing more than beads of colored glass.  Around her neck is a marriage
dagger, although it lacks the finery of the more expensive ones worn by
nobles, the dagger is still worn with pride by the woman.

This militiaman is one of many that patrol the streets of Remen.  Like
the rest of the militia, this man is an odd-looking sight; he is wearing a
mismatched mixture of old and rusty armor over his everyday tough woolen
clothing.  Despite his odd looks this man looks at ease with the weapon he
carries and is probably more dangerous than he first appears to be.

skirts that are gathered up to the knee to reveal brightly colored
petticoats.  With her is a battered tin tray used to help carry drinks and
food as well as a convenient shield against small missiles thrown by
aggravated customers.

This particular woman is much taller than the local women of Remen are;
her coppery complexion is a common feature of people from Arad Doman. 
Despite her exotic looks, this womans manner of dress is typical of this
region of Altara; she wears a pale pink dress with a very deep and narrow
neckline.  Her skirt is gathered up to one knee exposing her bright pink
petticoat.  Around this womans waist is a very thin red leather belt that
does not seem to match the rest of her attire.  Sheathed in her belt is a
curved knife, the type that Altarans use for dueling.

The head cook is a very intimidating looking woman with all the looks and

general appearance and her style of dress is typical of this region of
Altara.  The woman's long graying hair is tied neatly back away from her
face using a headscarf.  She wears a pale blue-gray dress with a deep yet
narrow neckline with her skirts gathered up to one knee to reveal a bright
blue petticoat worn underneath.  Worn over her clothing is a long white
apron that is slightly grubby from use.

A docile horse stands here, idly swishing its tail.
~
This is a rather docile looking horse that seems to be content in its own
dozy little world.  The horse's hair is a strange marble-like effect of
shades of gray and dull white although its mane and tail are pure white. 
Despite the lazy appearance of this four-legged beast, the horse looks like
a very muscular, sturdy individual with a lot of stamina.

a horse~
A light-footed horse seems very eager to be on the move.
~
This particular horse is a fine looking animal of good stock.  The animal
appears to have been recently painstakingly groomed; its glossy white hair
glistens in the light.  Despite this horse's lazy demeanor it is in
excellent condition and health and probably has good endurance.

~
This peddler is probably a citizen of Remen or from one of the other
nearby towns.  His style of garb is very typical of this region of Altara;
he wears a long vest made of brightly colored wool over his wide sleeved
shirt.  Slung over his shoulder is a small leather satchel in which this man
carries his spare change.  His baggy trousers are held up by a thick leather
belt in which is sheathed a curved knife, the type that Altarans use for
dueling.

This peddler is probably a citizen of Remen or from one of the other

pale dress with a very deep and narrow neckline.  Her skirts are gathered up
to one knee exposing her brightly colored petticoat.  Slung over her
shoulder is a small leather satchel in which this woman carries her spare
change.  Around this woman's waist is a belt in which is sheathed a curved
knife, the type that Altarans use for dueling.  Around her neck is a
marriage dagger, although it lacks the finery of the more expensive ones
worn by nobles, the dagger is still worn with pride by the woman.

Upon his head he wears a straw had with a wide brim, probably to keep the

him stands out from the citizens of town.  His baggy trousers are held up by

in color, his pale complexion and icy blue eyes seem to suggest that this
man may not be from this area.  He is a smartly dressed individual, his fine
woolen coat and breeches look well made although they appear to be
Cairhienin in style and not Altaran.

This old man is a rather gruff-looking individual with short white hair
and dark eyes.  His clothing appears to be very expensive, reminiscent of a
wealthy merchant or a trader.  His garments are made of finely woven wool
and linen and the golden jewelry set with semi-precious stones have a gaudy
look to them.  Around his neck this man wears a thick gold chain of office
that has been ornately inscribed, marking him as the Mayor of Remen.

A man sits at the desk, twiddling his thumbs.
~
His militiaman is a strangely garbed man with graying hair and despite
his apparent age this man is of a tall, athletic build.  There is something
about this man's stance that suggests that despite being a member of the
town militia this man has probably been in actual military service.  The
armor he wears is that of an officer from the Altaran Civil Guard,
beautifully crafted gilded armor that appears to be more for decorative
purposes than for real protection.  The coat and breeches made of fine wool
that he wears underneath his armor does not appear to be part of any uniform
although his garments look very expensive.

This oddly-dressed man is one of members of Remen's militia which patrol
the town.  Like the rest of the militia, this man is an peculiar looking
sight; he is wearing a mismatched mixture of old and rusty armor over his
everyday tough woolen clothing.  Despite his odd looks this man looks at
ease with the weapon he carries and is probably more dangerous than he first
appears to be.

very deep and narrow neckline with her skirt gathered up to one knee
exposing a brightly colored petticoat beneath it.  Around this woman's waist
is a long cloth sash and sheathed in his cloth sash is a knife with a long,
curved blade, the type that Altarans use for dueling.  Around her neck is a

stand out from the locals of Remen.  Around this woman's waist is a thick
leather belt upon which a curved dagger is sheathed and a fat coin purse is
hung.

A {Dt{wi{yny mou{ws{De{x scurries in and out of the shadows.
~
This is a small rat with beady black eyes, scruffy brown fur and a long
and sinuous tail.  This pesky little rodent darts in and out of the shadows,
trying hard not to be seen although the faint squeaking and scurrying noises
may provide a clue to where the rapidly moving rat is.  Rats are generally
thought of as spies for the Dark One and are considered to be evil.

A {ys{gt{Gran{gg{ye f{gi{Ggu{gr{ye{x sits on the edge of the bed, seeming lost in a daydream.
~
This strange figure appears to be an Ogier, a creature approximately nine
feet in height with very broad facial features, especially her nose that is
almost snout-like in appearance.  This Ogier has long shaggy black hair,
which is almost mane-like in its wild appearance although some parts of her
hair has been braided and adorned with small flowers.  Her long droopy
eyebrows seem to frame her huge yet pale colored eyes.  She wears a plain
flowing dress and hooded cloak that has been embroidered with a beautiful
pattern of flowers and vines.

maid~

A {mm{Mai{md{x scuttles along, seeming to be occupied with completing her chores.
~
This woman is one of the many maids employed at this inn to do the
general everyday chores such as cleaning.  She is probably a citizen of
Remen for both her general appearance and her style of dress is typical of
this region.  She wears a pale gray dress with a very deep and slim neckline
that leaves almost nothing to the imagination.  Her skirts are gathered up
to one knee exposing the white petticoat she wears beneath.  Tied around
this woman's waist is a small white apron that has been the target of a few
patrons' drinks and tucked into the apron strings is a curved dagger,
typical of those used by Altarans for dueling.

{wArafel is one of the Borderland nations that is devoted to protecting the
Blightborder.  It {x{wlies between Kandor to the west, and Shienar to the east,
with the Blight to the north.  {x{wThe eastern border between Arafel and Shienar
is formed by the Mora River and the {x{wsouthern border by the Erinin.  The
terrain of Arafel is much more rugged than that of {x{wits neighbor, Shienar,
and is at least partly made up of grasslands.  Like all of the {x{wBorderlands,
Arafel became a nation near the beginning of the War of the Hundred Years.  {x
{wThe governors of the five northern provinces met; the outcome of this
meeting was an {x{wagreement to form five stable nations.  The purpose of these
nations was to defend the {x{wrest of the continent against the Blight, and
therefore protecting the peace of the {x{wland.  {x

{wNative Arafellins are characterized by their large eyes and pale skin.  The
men wear their {x{whair long and in braids.  They usually attach silver bells to
the ends of their braids.  {x{wSome people consider the people of Arafel to have
a strange sense of honor and debts.  {x

{wKandor is one of the Borderland nations, dedicated to defending the
Blightborder.  It is {x{wsituated between Saldaea and Arafel, with the Blight to
the north.  At least part of {x{wKandor is mountainous.  The capital city of
Kandor is Chachin, located in the mountains {x{wof Kandor.  The merchants of
Chachin have a good reputation and considerable wealth, even {x{wthough the
city's nearness to the Blight prevents it from being a major trading city. 
{x{wAnother well known city in Kandor is Canluum, with the town of Ravinda
located between {x{wthe two.  {x

{wKandori people can be easily recognized by the earrings that they wear. 
They are worn by both {x{wmen and women, and can sometimes be quite
ostentatious.  Kandori men wear their beards in {x{wa distinctive forked style,
and often wear up to three silver chains over their coats.  {x{wLoose breeches
seem to be worn by both men and women alike.  {x

{wThere is not much specific information on the military of Kandor, but it is
known that the {x{wmartial arts are just as highly developed in Kandor as in the
other borderland nations.  {x{wThe army of Kandor is most likely similar to
those of Arafel, Saldaea and Shienar.  {x

{CCapital city: {cMalkier.  {x

{wMalkier was one of the twenty-four nations formed either during or shortly
after the War of {x{wthe Hundred Years.  It was one of five Borderlands until it
fell to the Blight in the {x{w950's NE.  It was located north of Shienar and
Arafel.  Malkier was known both for the {x{wseven towers, and for it's necklace
of a thousand lakes.  The towers still stand today, {x{wbroken and jagged, and
are circled by the lakes.  Other locations in Malkier include {x{wHerot's
Crossing and the Stair of Jehaan.  {x

{wThe nation of Malkier was a monarchy, ruled by a King and Queen.  At any
given time, there are {x{wsupposedly five Great Lords of Malkier.  In order to
name a new King, they must "cast the {x{wrods" and decide who is fit to be king.
In Malkier, unlike in some of the southlands, {x{wwhen a King is married, his
wife is crowned as Queen when they exchange rings.  Among the {x{wMalkieri, the
Kings are denoted by the "al" before their first name, and the Queens by {x{wthe
"el" before their first name.  {x

{wWomen in Malkier wear the ki'sain, a colored dot, on their forehead.  It
symbolizes their {x{wwillingness to pledge their sons to oppose the Shadow. 
Unmarried women wear a blue {x{wki'sain, married women wear a red ki'sain, and
widows wear a white ki'sain.  {x {wMen wear a hadori, a thin, braided leather
cord, around their foreheads to hold their hair {x{wback.  {x {wOne of the other
customs of Malkier is that of a carneira.  The word "carneira" translates to
{x{w"first", and regards a person's first lover.  While young women chose their
own carneira, {x{wyoung men do not have a choice; their carneira chooses them. 
When a young man is chosen {x{wby his carneira, she will have him make a daori,
a long cord woven of his hair.  When the {x{wman is holding the daori, his
carneira has the advantage over him; the daori must be {x{wtaken from the person
by the carneira in order for this advantage to be laid aside.  The {x{wdaori is
presented by the carneira to the man's bride on his wedding day.  There is a
{x{wsaying that "a king is not a king, alone with his carneira".  {x {wMost of the
Malkieri that remain alive have assimilated themselves into other nations
and {x{wcultures, trying to forget the memories of Malkier.  {x

{wThere is little specific information on Malkier's army, but it can be
assumed, of course, {x{wthat their army was very strong indeed.  Befoer the
destruction of Malkier Shienar was {x{wnot considered to be a Borderland because
of Malkier.  While the men of Shienar rode {x{wforth to help protect the
Blightborder, it was Malkier who held back the Blight.  {x

{wThe largest of the Border nations, Saldaea is larger than Shienar and Arafel
combined.  The {x{wSaldaeans are known for their tilted, almond-shaped eyes. 
While as ferocious in battle {x{was any of the Border nations, their equestrian
skills are undoubtedly superior.  The {x{wSaldaeans are the greatest light
cavalry in the world.  {x

{wFor Saldaeans, war is a family affair.  The wives of officers and nobles
accompany their {x{whusbands on all campaigns except those into the Blight. 
While not trained with the {x{wsword, Saldaean girls are quite skilled both with
knives and in hand-to-hand combat.  All {x{wSaldaeans are armed with at least a
knife at all times; in Saldaea, steel is not bared {x{wunless it will be used. 

{wThe Saldaean economy is strong.  Built upon the trade of furs, wood, and ice
peppers, Saldaean {x{wgoods fetch high prices at markets as far away as Tear.  {x

{wAnother important part of Saldaean life is the sa'sara, a dance outlawed by
several Saldaean {x{wqueens for its indecency.  While known by virtually every
noblewoman, few would ever {x{wadmit to the knowledge.  Apparently, the sa'sara
has the ability to drive men wild.  The {x{wsa'sara is known to have started
three wars and sparked two rebellions, among many other {x{wsmaller
disturbances.  {x

{COther towns: {cFal Dara, Fal Eisen and Mos Shirare.{x

{wIt is a tremendous struggle for the people of Fal Dara to live so close
to the Blight.  The {x{wconstant fighting greatly affects the way the Shienaran
warriors view life.  The three {x{wmost important values to the Shienaran
warriors are peace, beauty, and life.  Peace, {x{wbecause they have never known
it.  Beauty, because they are so near the corruption of the {x{wBlight.  Life,
because they are sworn to death.  {x

{wTo the Shienaran warriors, it is the quality of life that matters, not any
material wealth {x{wthat is gained.  The soldiers are buried unclothed.  It is
their belief that all came from {x{wthe earth, and they wish to return as they
came to the last embrace of the mother.  {x

{wThe Shienarans are the finest heavy cavalry in the world.  Like Fal Dara,
all of the towns in {x{wShienar are built to function as fortresses.  All are
built on hills, to gain a {x{wcommanding view of the countryside.  They are
surrounded by stone walls and heavy iron {x{wgates.  Nothing taller than short
grass is allowed to remain for at least a half-mile {x{wbeyond the town walls. 

{wShienar's capital city is Fal Moran.  However, it is the cities closer to
the Blightborder, {x{wsuch as Fal Dara, which more closely embody the fighting
spirit of Shienar.  Everything {x{wexcept the surrounding farms are enclosed
within the city walls.  Fal Dara, and the {x{wcities like it, were built for
strength and beauty.  {x

{wLike all cities along the Blightborder, no man may be permitted to wear a
hood or cover their {x{wface within the city walls.  This is an effort to
prevent Myrddraal from entering into {x{wthe cities.  Also, the streets of these
cities are very well lighted, to try and prevent {x{wthe shadows the Myrddraal
need to appear and disappear at will.  {x

{CCapital city:{c Ebou Dar.{x
{COther towns: {cRemen.{x

{wAltara lies between the more powerful nations of Illian and Amadicia. {x
{wAltara itself is barely a unified nation, with most Altarans preferring to{x
{wrefer to themselves as subjects of one noble or another.  The only reason{x
{wAltara was not taken over during the Whitecloak War was the aid of Illian;{x
{wIllian intervened only to maintain Altara as a buffer between Amadicia and{x
{witself.  {x

{wThe Altarans are a fierce, but polite, people.  This is most evident in the{x
{wprevalence of dueling in Altaran culture.  Most men and women have{x
{wparticipated in at least one duel by the time they reach adulthood, priding{x
{wthemselves on their courage.  As in many other countries, men duel over the{x
{wrights to a woman, with the woman going to the victor.  Unique to Altara,{x
{wthough, is women dueling over men.  The death of a man at the hands of a{x
{wwoman is justified unless proven otherwise, which results in men treating{x
{wthese dangerous Altaran women with the utmost respect.  {x

{wNowhere is the Altaran nature more evident than the capital city of Ebou{x
{wDar.  Ebou Dar is divided into two sections by the River Eldar.  The west{x
{wside is filled palaces and large buildings.  All of these buildings are{x
{wpale, made of white rock or lightly colored marble.  The west side of the{x
{wcity is surrounded by a large, thick wall.  {x

{wThe east side of Ebou Dar is known as the Rahad.  The Rahad, poorer than the{x
{wwestern portion of the city, is filled with lightly colored buildings,{x
{wpainted white to resemble the richer buildings on the opposite side of the{x
{wriver.  The streets are more likely to be alleys, and are filled with a much{x
{wrougher population than the west side of the city.  Duels are an hourly{x
{woccurrence, and those foolish enough to wear fine clothes into the Rahad are{x
{woften killed for them.  {x

{wAltara is a nation weakened by a lack of unity, and is available for the{x
{wtaking by a nation powerful enough to seize it.{x

{wArad Doman plays a rather minor role in the politics of the land.  It is has{x
{wlong maneuvered to gain control of Almoth Plain, with Tarabon similarly{x
{wtrying to gain control of this piece of land.  {x

{wDomani women are the source of the nation's fame, as only the Sea Folk women{x
{ware more graceful.  Domani women wear clothes considered scandalous in most{x
{wcountries, and have raised the practice of seduction to an art.  Mothers{x
{wbegin teaching their daughters this art at an early age.  {x

{wIf Arad Doman owes its fame to its women, it similarly owes its national{x
{wwealth to them.  Most Domani merchants are women, and few men come out on{x
{wtop after a bargaining session with a Domani woman.  Most men, however,{x
{wconsider losing to be worth the experience.  {x

{wThe capital of Arad Doman is Bandar Eban, which also serves as a center of{x
{wtrade.  The Domani trade a great deal with the Sea Folk, and are among the{x
{wfew merchants in the land who can hold their own against in bargaining with{x
{wthe Sea Folk. {x

{WIllian{x
{CBanner: {cNine golden bees on a field of green.{x
{COther symbols: {cThe Laurel Crown and the Golden Bees.{x
{CCapital city: {cIllian.{x

{wIllian is a strong nation on the Sea of Storms.  It has grown rich on the{x
{wtrade that flows into the nation by river and sea.  Illian has a very solid{x
{wrelationship with neighboring Altara.  It was Illian that protected Altara{x
{wduring the Whitecloak War, seeking to maintain Altara as a buffer between{x
{witself and Amadicia.  {x

{wIllian is not governed solely by the King.  Illian also has an advisory{x
{wCouncil of Nine, made up of nine nobles.  Additionally, the Assemblage, also{x
{wan advisory entity, is made up of the richest merchants and traders in the{x
{wkingdom.  {x

{wThe King and the Council of Nine have struggled for power since the nation{x
{wof Illian was established.  The first King told the first Council that they{x
{wcould have any palace, so long as it was not larger than his own.  So the{x
{wCouncil proceeded to erect a palace identical to the King's, but smaller in{x
{wevery dimension by one foot.  These two palaces, standing on opposite sides{x
{wof the great Square of Tammaz, exemplify the power struggle that is the{x
{wIllianer government.  {x

{wOf course, the Assemblage also seeks to add to its own power.  This power{x
{wstruggle makes the Illianer government slow and ineffective, leaving most{x
{wIllianers to live as they wish.  {x

{wOne legendary item of history has special ties with Illian - the Horn of{x
{wValere.  The first Hunt of the Horn in Illian was called between the Trolloc{x
{wWars and the War of the Hundred Years.  Another Hunt was recently called in{x
{wIllian, and heroes came to seek the Horn or at least a place in history.  {x

{wThough Illian's military might is formidable, its finest soldiers are those{x
{wwithin the elite unit called the Illianer Companions.  These crack troops{x
{wtraditionally ride with the commanding general during any military action,{x
{wto be deployed wherever their extraordinary abilities are needed, usually in{x
{wthe hottest fighting.  During the Whitecloak War, the Children of the Light {x
{wset a trap at Soremaine that caught King Stepeneos and would have destroyed{x
{whis entire army if it were not for the valour of the Companions.  They held{x
{wthe field long enough to allow the rest of the army to escape to safety, and{x
{wthus prevented Altara, as well as Murandy and Illian, from falling under the{x
{wsway of the Whitecloaks.{x

{CCapital city: {cTanchico.{x
{COther towns:{c Elmora.{x

{wThe people of Tarabon like to refer to themselves as the Tree of Man, and{x
{wclaim to be the descendants of the nobles and rulers of the Age of Legends. {x
{wEarly in its history, it is believed that Tarabon possessed either a branch{x
{wor a living sapling of Avendesora, the Tree of Life.  {x

{wTarabon has squabbled with Arad Doman throughout its history for the{x
{wpossession of Almoth Plain.  Only recently, though, has this conflict{x
{wevolved into actual war.  Tarabon was once a powerful nation, with a strong{x
{weconomy and great political influence.  Recently Tarabon has fallen on hard{x
{wtimes, with a faltering economy and diminishing power in the world.  {x

{wTarabon is ruled in a very unique way, jointly by a king and a panarch.  The{x
{welection of these two rulers is the only real function of Tarabon's Assembly{x
{wof Lords.  The King is responsible for spending revenue, controls the army,{x
{wand oversees the High Court.  The Panarch collects revenues, commands the{x
{wCivil Watch, and is in charge of the lower courts.  {x

{wTanchico is the capital city of Tarabon, and is one of the oldest surviving{x
{wcities on the continent.  Some historians claim that parts of the Panarch's{x
{wpalace was built during the Age of Legends.  Tanchico itself is larger than{x
{wcities such as Tear and Caemlyn, and is a great center of trade and{x
{wentertainment.{x

{COther symbols:{x {cThe Crescent Moons and the Stone of Tear.{x
{CCapital city: {cTear.{x
{COther towns: {cGodan.{x

{wTear is one of the richest nations in the land.  This comes in part from{x
{wcontrolling the greatest port on the Sea of Storms.  A great deal of Tear's{x
{wwealth comes from the oil produced on the country's numerous olive farms. {x
{wLucrative trade in grain and fish also brings money into rich nation of{x
{wTear.   However, it is only the nobles of Tear who have grown rich off the{x
{wnation's vast wealth.  This is because of the view unique to Tairen lords{x
{wthat commoners are actually lesser beings.  The distinction between Tairen{x
{wlords and commoners is a sharp one, to the point where they even dress{x
{wdifferently.  Until very recently, it was not even possible for a commoner{x
{wto call a noble before a magistrate.  {x
 
{wUnlike most nations, Tear is not ruled by a king or queen.  Instead, Tear is{x
{wruled by the High Lords.  The number of High Lords has varied over time from{x
{wsix to twenty, but they are always of a particular rank.  {x
 
{wThe city of Tear goes further in enforcing the differences between commoners{x
{wand nobles.  The inner city is surrounded by a high wall of gray stone. {x
{wWithin the wall are the finer houses and palaces of the nobles, which line{x
{wstreets paved with stone.  Outside the wall, commoners trudge through{x
{wunpaved, muddy streets.  {x
 
{wThe city of Tear is dominated by the Stone of Tear, which towers above the{x
{wcity like a small mountain.  It is believed to be the oldest stronghold of{x
{wmankind, erected shortly after the Breaking of the World.  It was built with{x
{wthe One Power, Earth, Air, and Fire fusing stones together without joint or{x
{wmortar.   Deep within the Stone is the Heart of the Stone.  This is where{x
{wthe great sword Callandor is held, protected by the One Power.  Callandor is{x
{wactually one of the greatest sa'angreal ever, waiting for the Dragon Reborn{x
{wto claim it.  No one except the High Lords are allowed to enter the Heart,{x
{wand even they rarely enter it.  The High Lords only enter the Heart four{x
{wtimes a year for the Rite of Guarding, and to raise a lord to a High Lord. {x
{wIndeed, if the High Lords could manage to forget that the Heart of the Stone{x
{wand Callandor existed, they undoubtedly would.   This is due partly to the{x
{wfact that it is prophesied that the Stone will not fall until the Dragon has{x
{wbeen Reborn.  The High Lords like to think that by protecting Callandor,{x
{wthey are protecting the world from the Dragon Reborn.{x
{wAlso, Tairens fear anything to do with the One Power.  Aes Sedai are{x
{wforbidden to channel while in Tear.  The Stone also houses a collection of{x
{wangreal and ter'angreal second only to the White Tower.  It is unsure{x
{wexactly why the Tairens have collected such an array; perhaps to prevent{x
{wtheir use by Aes Sedai, or maybe to ease the knowledge that they possess the{x
{wgreatest of them, Callandor.{x

{wAmadicia itself is a relatively minor player in world politics.  It is{x
{wbetter known as the home of the Children of the Light.  It is the Children{x
{wwho rule in Amadicia.  The Children allow the monarchy to continue in{x
{wAmadicia, largely to avoid ceremonial duties.  The current ruler, King{x
{wAilron, actually does have some small amount of power; this power will only{x
{wlast as long as he does not go against the wishes of the Children, of{x
{wcourse.  {x

{wThe capital city is Amador, which is also the location of the Fortress of{x
{wthe Light.  All know that it is the Fortress which holds the real power in{x
{wAmadicia, not the King's Serenda Palace.  {x
{wChanneling is outlawed in Amadicia, at order of the Children, causing Aes{x
{wSedai to avoid the country if at all possible.  Even if they did not{x
{wchannel, their ageless features would undoubtedly bring them unwanted{x
{wattention.  {x

{wAes Sedai are not the only ones who avoid Amadicia whenever possible. {x
{wAmadicia's harsh laws serve to frighten away common criminals, such as{x
{wthieves.  A person is branded the first time they are caught stealing, loses{x
{wa hand for the second, and is hanged after their third offense.  {x

{wAmadicia, as a nation, plays little role in the politics of the world.  The{x
{wChildren, however, are another matter.  Children of the Light can be found{x
{win virtually every nation, and also present a sizable military presence in{x

{COther symbols:{c The White Lion, Rose Crown of Andor and the Lion Throne.{x
{CCapital city: {cCaemlyn.{x
{COther towns: {cBaerlon, Whitebridge, Aringill and Fourkings.{x

{wAndor is the largest nation in the land, and is one of the oldest as{x
{wwell.  It was founded during the War of the Hundred Years.  Many of Andor's{x
{wtraditions were established during these early years.  Unlike many nobles of{x
{wthe time, Queen Ishara, Andor's first ruler, knew that no one ruler would be{x
{wable to take control of Hawkwing's entire empire.  Instead, she focused on{x
{wcontrolling only what she could.  As a result, Andor began only with the{x
{wcapital city of Caemlyn and the small surrounding villages.  Cautious{x
{wexpansion marked the reigns of the early queens of Andor.  {x
 
{wThe oldest tradition of Andor is that only a queen must sit on the Lion{x
{wThrone of Andor, and wear the Rose Crown.  The eldest daughter is known as{x
{wthe Daughter-Heir, and is always sent to Tar Valon to study.  The eldest{x
{wbrother of the Daughter-Heir is sworn to protect her with his life, and is{x
{wprepared from an early age to take control of Andor's army.  {x

{wCaemlyn is the capital city, second in beauty only to Tar Valon.  The city{x
{wof Caemlyn is actually made up of two cities, the New City and the Inner{x
{wCity.  The New City is less than two thousand years old, constructed{x
{wexclusively by humans.  The ancient Inner City, on the other hand, was{x
{wconstructed by Ogier.  The entire city is encircled by a fifty-foot wall;{x
{wthe Inner City itself is also surrounded by a wall.  Certainly the most{x
{wimpressive building in the Inner City is the Royal Palace, which serves as{x
{wthe seat of government for Andor.{x
 
{wAndor is a strong nation, backed by a strong army consisting primarily of{x
{wthe Queen's Guards.  Andor has always been under almost constant pressure{x
{wfrom neighboring countries.  Andor and Cairhien have to been to war more{x
{wtimes than any two countries except for Tear and Illian.  Similarly, the{x
{wChildren of the Light have always had a reason to dislike Andor, as the{x
{wqueen always studies in the White Tower.  {x

{wAndor's strength comes from its wealth.  Much of this is generated in the{x
{wMountains of Mist, far to the west of central Andor.  Gold, silver, iron,{x
{wand copper are extracted from the rich mines in these mountains.  Most of{x
{wthis metal is refined in the smelters near the mines.  {x

{wMost of the iron, however, is sent to the Baerlon Ironworks, famous{x
{wthroughout the land for the quality of its work.  The last several Queens{x
{whave had trouble controlling this region, however.  Luckily for these{x
{wQueens, the metal coming out of Baerlon must travel through the rest of{x
{wAndor to reach the rest of the land.  This might be the only thing that{x
{wallows the crown to retain control of an area so important to its economy. {x

{wThe strength which must be expended to retain the valuable mines in the{x
{wMountains of Mist means that other outlying regions of Andor have been{x
{wvirtually forgotten.  A good example of this is the Two Rivers, where few{x
{weven realize they are part of a larger kingdom.  One well-known town in the{x
{wfar west of Andor is Whitebridge, so named for the large bridge which{x
{wcrosses the River Arinelle into the town.{x

{wCairhien, like many of the current nations, became sovereign at the end
of the War of the {x{wHundred Years.  The nation of Cairhien now spreads over
less than half the land it once {x{wcontrolled.  {x

{wThe Cairhienin had a period of four hundred years in which they enjoyed a
period of {x{wunprecedented wealth.  This was brought about by the Aiel's
granting of the right to cross {x{wthe Aiel Waste and trade for silk in Shara. 
This prosperity ended when Laman Damodred cut {x{wdown Avendoraldera and
unknowingly sparked the Aiel War.  It was during this war that the {x{wcity of
Cairhien was burned to the ground.  {x

{wThe politics of Cairhien are dominated by the Great Game, the Game of
Houses.  The nobles took {x{wthe plotting and intricacies of life within the
White Tower, and gave it their own twist.  {x{wAlso called Daes Dae'mar, it is
responsible for almost every major disaster in Cairhien's {x{whistory.  To the
Cairhienin, everyone has a hidden motive, every word has another meaning. 
{x{wEverything is believed to be a move to gain more power and strength.  {x

{wThe Cairhienin are a very reserved people.  They also prefer complete
control over their {x{wenvironment.  This can be seen in the layout of the city
of Cairhien, which is a precise {x{wgrid pattern, all streets meeting at right
angles.  {x

{wThe only time the Cairhienin reserve breaks is during the Feast of Lights. 
During this two day {x{wcelebration, all social barriers fall.  Any man may kiss
any woman, and any woman may kiss {x{wany man.  After the two days are over,
life precedes as if nothing had occurred.  {x

{wGhealdan is a relatively small nation, lying between Garen's Wall and the

Altara to the east.  To the north {x{wlie the Forest of Shadows, the
Manetherendrelle and a short, almost impassible border with {x{wAndor.  {x

{wAccording to the maps, Ghealdan is entirely made up of land formerly claimed
by Dhowlan.  Most {x{wmaps show it as taking most of that land, but others shows
it as taken virtually all, with {x{wessentially none of the land having been
part of other countries.  Apart from a small part {x{wof what was Eharon during
the time of the Compact of the Ten Nations, the land that is now {x{wGhealdan
was part of the nation of Manetheren.  {x

{wThe main military group in Ghealdan is the Legion of the Wall.  {x

{wPeople in Ghealdan are often wary of strangers.  Little is known of the
dress and appearance of {x{wGhealdanin, though they tend to be dark of hair and

{wThe people of Murandy, much like the people of Altara, do not really{x

{wclaim allegiance to one or another of the local lords.  {x
 
{wThe ruler of Murandy seldom controls events outside of the capital city of{x
{wLugard.  Even within Lugard, the monarch is sometimes helpless to affect the{x
{wcourse of events.  The only reason a monarch is tolerated in Murandy is as a{x
{wdeterrent to incursions by foreign nations.  {x
 
{wThe capital city of Lugard is located in central Murandy, and it is the{x
{wtrade flowing through Lugard which keeps Murandy alive.  Despite whatever{x
{wpolitical conflict might be disrupting daily life in Murandy, trade{x
{wcontinues to flow through Lugard.  It is one of few cities which has more{x
{winns and stables than residences and shops.  {x
 
{wLugard was once surrounded by a tall stone wall, but it has since crumbled. {x
{wIn many places around the city, piles of rubble mark where the wall once{x
{wstood.  The many thieves who call Lugard home consider any foreigner a fair{x
{wmark, and the unpaved roads and alleys are frequently dangerous to travel{x
{walone.  {x
 
{wMurandy plays a minor role in world politics.  The lack of an effective{x
{wruler makes it difficult for Murandy to defend itself, much less to make its{x
{wpresence felt in the rest of the land.{x

{wAlmoth Plain is located on the west coast of the Westlands between Arad
Doman and Tarabon.  The {x{wnation of Almoth once occupied this territory. 
There is currently no formal government and {x{wthere are no large towns or
cities.  Arad Doman and Tarabon have fought over ownership of {x{wAlmoth Plain
for the last four hundred years.  {x

{WFar Madding{x

{wLocated in the Plains of Maredo, Far Madding was the main city in the long
disappeared nation {x{wof Maredo.  It is now ruled by the Counsels, where the
title of First Counsel is given to {x{wthe "first among equals."  There are
thirteen Counsels (including the First Counsel), all {x{wwomen and the majority
aged.  They originally were the advisors to the Queens of Maredo {x{wbut took
over once Maredo was "dissolved."  {x

{wFar Madding is a center for trade.  There are three main markets: The
Avharin Market, the Amhara {x{wMarket and the Nethvin Market.  The largest of
these is the Avharin Market.  The central {x{wfocus of the square is a statue of
a woman called Einion Avharin which points toward {x{wCaemlyn.  The city acts as
a meeting place for Andoran, Tairen, and Illianer merchants; {x{wconsequently,
its inns are always full of such folk.  However all the more important
people {x{win Far Madding have large houses or palaces in an area called the
Heights that overlooks {x{wthe Hall of the Counsels.  {x

{wSecurity in Far Madding is very tight.  The city itself is on an island in
the middle of a lake {x{wwith only three bridges connecting to the mainland. 
These are the Ikane, Ajalon and Goine {x{wbridges that lead eventually to
Illian, Andor and Tear respectively.  At each bridge every {x{wman with a weapon
must have it{x {w'peace bonded' by law.  This consists of a complex net woven
around the blade.  If the bonds are {x{wfound to have been tampered with or
broken then the person owning the weapon can be thrown {x{win prison. 
Additionally, names are taken of all people entering the city.  But setting
{x{waside all these precautions, there is something much more impressive within
Far Madding, {x{wand that is the Guardian*.  {x

{w* The Guardian is a ter'angreal, or perhaps even two, that creates two
artificial stedding.  The {x{wlarger affects male channelers and the smaller,
inner one affects females.  If someone {x{wchannels outside the city, the
Guardian can also pinpoint the location of the source by {x{wuse of
triangulation.  It can differentiate between saidar and saidin as well.  The
actual {x{wter'angreal is set in the floor in the Hall of the Counsels.  An
arrow in the center of the {x{wdisplay used for locating use of the One Power
changes color according to the nature of {x{wthe Power used: black for saidin
and red for saidar.  {x

{wNevertheless, as with everything, the Guardian has weaknesses.  These have
only recently been {x{wused and exploited through wells that enable the user to
store limited amounts of the One {x{wPower to carry into the city.  This
loophole is effective for either half of the True {x{wSource.  {x

{WMayene{x

{COther symbols: {cThe Golden Hawk.{x

{wA short distance to the east of Tear lies the small city-state of Mayene.
Mayene claims {x{windependence, but the High Lords of Tear deny this, claiming
that Mayene is a province of {x{wTear.  {x

{wDespite these claims, no Tairen knows the location of the secret oilfish
shoals which are the {x{wsource of Mayene's wealth and fragile hold on
independence.  And the Mayeners plan to keep {x{wit this way.  The oil which the
Mayeners produce serves as lamp oil and competes with {x{wsimilar products from
Tear, Illian, and Tarabon.  {x

{wThe ruling family of Mayene claims to be the direct descendants of Artur
Hawkwing and still go {x{wby the Paendrag name.  Mayene's ruler is called "the
First."  These rulers have struggled {x{wfor generations to keep Mayene
independent from its much larger neighbor.  {x

{wOne great tool the Mayener rulers used to maintain Mayene's autonomy was a
ter'angreal doorway {x{wwhich took them to the land of the Aelfinn and Eelfinn. 
They were allowed to ask any three {x{wquestions, and receive three true
answers.  These answers were a great aid to the Firsts in {x{wmaintaining
Mayene's independence from Tear.  But this advantage was given away by a
young {x{wruler who gave away the ter'angreal to the Tairens as a sign of good
will.  He had already {x{wused it, and so it was no longer of any use to him.  {x

{wDespite this loss, Mayene has remained independent for hundreds of years. 
This small city-state {x{wfaces a constant challenge from the bulk of Tear to
the west, but the Mayeners are intent {x{won remaining apart from the High Lords
of Tear.  {x

{WTar Valon{x

{wThe city of Tar Valon, nestled on an island in the River Erinin, is probably
the center of {x{wpolitics in the world.  Tar Valon is independent of any
nation, as it is the location of {x{wthe White Tower.  The White Tower,
naturally, is the center of Aes Sedai authority.  As {x{wsuch, it is certainly
the more important politically than any nation's capital.  {x

{wTar Valon is regarded as the premier work of the Ogier masons, though
Caemlyn is a close {x{wsecond.  Buildings flow organically from one to the next,
each building created to accent {x{wthose around it.  The beauty of Tar Valon is
dominated by the White Tower itself, rising {x{whigh above the city.  {x

{wBeing the political center that it is, Tar Valon is also a wealthy city.  It
is filled with {x{wmerchants and shops, catering to the wealthy citizens of this
richest of cities.  Despite {x{wthe wealth evident in the city, crime is
unknown.  Those caught stealing are sent to the {x{wTower where a sister has a
little talk with the thief; these thieves are seldom caught a {x{wsecond time. 

{wWhile there are many who fear or even dislike the Aes Sedai who hold sway in
Tar Valon, none {x{wcan deny the beauty of this city.  The Ogier truly outdid
themselves in its construction, {x{wand any traveler would do well to make a
stop in Tar Valon.  {x

{RAginor{x
 
{rThe man called Aginor was the second most powerful of the male Forsaken and{x
{rcame close to rivaling both Lews Therin and Ishamael in strength with the{x
{rOne Power.  He was originally named Ishar Morrad Chuain, and was one of the{x
{rforemost biological scientists of the Age of Legends whose work mainly{x
{rconcerned new variation of plant life, both as crops and as ornamentals.  He{x
{rdid not ascribe to the widely held belief that everything worth discovering{x
{rhad already been discovered.  {x

{rHe was one of the first Forsaken to turn to the Great Lord of the Dark. {x
{rAginor apparently turned to the Shadow so he could perform the experiments{x
{rhe wanted to.  Before turning to the Dark One, he was reprimanded several{x
{rtimes for performing unauthorized experiments.  He used his skills as a{x
{rbiological scientist to help the Shadow tremendously.  It was Aginor who{x
{rcreated the Shadowspawn, the first of which were the Trollocs.  Some of his{x
{rcreations are still very well known, such as the Draghkar, whilst some are{x
{ronly known through historical records such as the Gholam and the Jumara. {x

{RAsmodean{x
 
{rBefore turning to the Shadow, Joar Addam Nessosin was an accomplished{x
{rmusician.  A child prodigy, who was accomplished at both composition and{x
{rperformance, he never fully fulfilled his childhood promise.  It was for{x
{rthis reason that Asmodean turned to the Shadow.  With the promise of{x
{rimmortality, he could eventually reach musical heights he was destined for. {x

{rAsmodean was never a general for any army, though he did serve as a governor{x
{rof conquered territories.  Perhaps one of his greatest atrocities was the{x
{rrevenge he took against the world's most famous musicians and artists. {x
{rAsmodean had these artists maimed so they would never again be able to{x
{rperform their art before releasing them.  {w {x

{RBalthamel{x
 
{rBefore turning to the Shadow, Eval Ramman was a historian, unable to{x
{rdistinguish himself enough to earn the coveted third name.  He specialized{x
{rin the study of vanished cultures, but his work was not outstanding.  Eval{x
{rRamman had a bad temper which almost caused him to be bound with the One{x
{rPower to prevent him from doing something violent.  {x

{rHe enjoyed consorting with the lower elements of society, and was very{x
{rpopular with the women.  Perhaps the only reason he did not lose his job was{x
{rhis great strength with the One Power.  The man to be known as Balthamel{x
{rwent to the Shadow for the simple promise of immortality.  {x

{rBalthamel might have run an intelligence network which competed with that{x

{rto breed humans as food for the Trolloc armies which were ravaging the land.{x

{RBe'lal{x
 
{rBe'lal, the Envious, is certainly the Forsaken of whom the least is known. {x
{rA master of manipulation, his reputation led him to be known as the{x
{rNetweaver.  Originally he was Duram Laddel Cham.  Little is known of{x
{rBe'lal's life before he turned to the Shadow.  Some records indicate that{x
{rhe, like Sammael had been one of the leaders in the fight against the{x
{rShadow.  He went over to the Shadow during the Collapse although it is not{x
{rknown whether or not he joined at the beginning or the end.  {x
 
{rBe'lal was a better manipulator than Rahvin and more skillful than Sammael{x
{rin dealing with enemies in open conflict.  For this reason Be'lal was an{x
{rextremely dangerous adversary.  Be'lal is suspected to be among those who{x

{RDemandred{x
 
{rDemandred was originally known as Barid Bel Medar.  Barid Bel Medar could{x
{rhave been the most influential and acclaimed man of his Age, if it were not{x
{rfor Lews Therin.  He was born one day after Lews Therin, almost as powerful{x
{ras the Dragon and almost as skilled.  In the end it was because of his envy{x
{rof Lews Therin that Demandred turned to the Shadow.  {x
 
{rDuring the War of Power, Demandred finally discovered something at which he{x
{rwas at least the equal of Lews Therin - as a military commander in the fight{x
{ragainst the Shadow.  When Lews Therin was named commander of the forces{x
{ropposing the Shadow, Demandred was furious.  He believed himself the{x
{rintellectual superior to the Dragon.  He made the cold calculation that with{x
{rLews Therin commanding the forces opposing the Shadow, the Shadow would win.{x
{rIt was then that Demandred then decided to side with the Dark One. {x

{RGraendal{x
 
{rGraendal is the most decadent of the Forsaken, wearing enormous gemstones{x
{rand barely transparent gowns.  Before she turned to the Shadow, Kamarile{x
{rMaradim Nindar lived a simple, ascetic life.  She was the Age of Legend's{x
{requivalent of a psychologist, curing mental illnesses too extreme to be{x
{rHealed using the One Power.  Her gift did not stem from strength in the use{x
{rof the One Power; her true power was her keen insight into human motivation{x
{rand behavior.  {x
 
{rThough she was loved by the masses (most of them had only heard of her good{x
{rworks), those who knew her personally tended not to get along well with{x
{rKamarile.  She was highly critical of those who did not live up to her{x
{rstandards; and as those standards were absurdly idealistic, she wound up{x
{rbeing disappointed by most people.  Within ten years after the Bore was{x
{rdrilled Graendal adopted the decadent behavior that is now synonymous with{x
{rher name, becoming the opposite of all that she had been.  There is no{x
{revidence to suggest that this change in behavior was caused by the Dark One.{x
{rBecause the world failed to meet her standards she turned to the Shadow.  If{x
{rthe world would not accept her guidance, she decided that she would lend her{x
{rincredible skills at manipulation to the Shadow.  {x
 
{rAlthough she led no armies for the Shadow, her considerable skill at{x
{rintrigue (and her unparalleled ability to use Compulsion) has aided the{x
{rShadow immensely.  {w {x

{RIshamael{x
 
{rIshamael means "Betrayer of Hope" in the Old Tongue.  Ishamael was among the{x
{rfirst, if not the first, to pledge his soul to the Dark One.  He was the{x
{rstrongest of the Forsaken and was equaled by none but Lews Therin Telamon{x
{rhimself.  Ishamael was also known as Ba'alzamon, Heart of the Dark, and Soul{x
{rof the Shadow.  Before turning to the Shadow, Ishamael's name was Elan Morin{x
{rTedronai and he was a prominent philosopher of the time.  {x
 
{rAfter turning to the Shadow, Ishamael fought hard to convert Lews Therin to{x
{rthe Shadow.  Some parts of articles that he wrote after turning to the{x
{rShadow indicate his belief that the war between the soul of Lews Therin and{x
{rthe Shadow had gone on since creation.  He viewed this as an endless battle{x
{rbetween the Creator and the Dark One, using human surrogates and that in{x
{rsome previous turnings of the Wheel, Lews Therin's soul had become a{x
{rchampion of the Dark One.  {x
 
{rIt is believed by some that when Lews Therin and the Hundred Companions{x
{rsealed the Bore, Ishamael was not fully trapped.  According to the{x
{rspeculations made by historian Aran son of Malan son of Senar (born circa{x
{r50AB), it may have taken many years for Ishamael to be drawn fully into the{x
{rtrap that had imprisoned the other Forsaken when the Bore was sealed by Lews{x
{rTherin and the Hundred Companions.  If this was so then Ishamael may have{x
{rbeen thrown out of the prison at regular intervals.  Based on observations{x
{rmade in his lifetime, Aran was unable to prove his theory although there{x
{rhave been at least two periods of huge upheaval since the Breaking that{x
{rbears the hallmark of a Forsaken at work, the Trolloc Wars and the War of{x
{rthe Hundred Years.  {w {x

{RLanfear{x
 
{rLanfear's original name was Mierin Eronaile.  Unlike the other Forsaken,{x
{rLanfear chose her own name, which means "Daughter of the Night" in the Old{x
{rTongue.  Mierin was extremely beautiful, possibly the most beautiful woman{x
{rof any Age.  She also became the most powerful female Forsaken, and the{x
{rsecond most powerful over all, topped only by Ishamael.  {x
 
{rMierin worked at Collam Daan, the primary center for research into the One{x
{rPower.  Although Aes Sedai of the time could do things that are undreamt of{x
{rby today's Aes Sedai, Mierin and her colleagues chafed at the limitations{x
{rplaced on their powers by the division between saidin and saidar.  The team{x
{rof researchers Mierin led believed that they had discovered a source of{x
{rpower that could be wielded by either sex.  What they had actually{x
{rdiscovered, though, was a section of the Pattern where the "wall" of the{x
{rDark One's prison had become dangerously thin.  Although she believed that{x
{rthey were helping mankind with their work, Mierin led the group responsible{x
{rfor drilling the Bore, the hole in the Dark One's prison.  All available{x
{revidence suggests that Mierin was unaware of the effect that her actions{x
{rwould have on the future of the world.  {x
 
{rMierin and Lews Therin Telamon had once been in a serious relationship.  It{x
{reventually became clear to Lews Therin that Mierin did not love him so much{x
{ras she loved being associated with him (and his considerable power).  When{x
{rhe left her and married Ilyena Moerelle Dalisar, Mierin became increasingly,{x
{rand dangerously, obsessed with Lews Therin.  Or, more specifically, she{x
{rbecame obsessed with reclaiming the man that she felt had been stolen from{x
{rher.  It is most likely that Mierin's love (and hatred) for Lews Therin{x
{rdrove her to swear to the Shadow.  {x
 
{rLanfear never led any of the Shadow's armies, but she did serve as the{x
{rgovernor of many conquered territories.  The suicide rate was considerable{x
{rin all Shadow-controlled regions, but in Lanfear's territories it was above{x
{raverage.  Her great skill in Tel'aran'rhiod allowed her to further the{x
{rShadow's cause without ever entering a battle.  Her methods ranged from{x
{rinciting entire cities to riot against the established authority to{x
{rtormenting or assassinating an individual using the victim's own dreams{x
{ragainst him.  Suffice to say, those governed by Lanfear did not sleep{x
{reasily.{x

{RMesaana{x
 
{rUnlike many of the people who would eventually become known as the Forsaken,{x
{rSaine Tarasind was not among the best in her profession.  Saine harbored{x
{rdreams of becoming a researcher since she had been very young.  But she was{x
{rturned down for a research position at Collam Daan; she ended up teaching{x
{rthere instead.  Rather than making discoveries, she found herself teaching{x
{rabout the discoveries of others.  {x
 
{rUnfulfilled, Saine turned to the Shadow.  Mesaana proved that she was an{x
{radequate general, but was brilliant as a governor of conquered territory. {x
{rHer administrations were efficient, and she started schools which taught{x
{rchildren to spy and report on each other.  These same children were{x
{rencouraged to destroy museums and other sources of ancient knowledge.  It{x
{rwas important to root up and obliterate the old order, in preparation of the{x
{rDark One's triumph.  {w {x

{RMoghedien{x
 
{rThe Spider was originally known as Lillen Moiral.  Lillen was an advisor for{x
{rinvestments, and was cautioned a number of times for violating the laws and{x
{rethics of the business.  Moghedien turned to the Shadow long before the War{x
{rof Power actually began.  However, she joined Lews Therin's staff and gained{x
{ra position of high standing.  Several disasters early in the war were the{x
{rresult of her work.  Some people, including some of the Forsaken, looked{x
{rdown upon her for lurking in the shadows.  Moghedien resented this.  She ran{x
{ra very efficient intelligence and sabotage network, which was a great aid to{x
{rthe cause of the Shadow.  Her greatest talent was her expertise in{x
{rTel'aran'rhiod.  In the World of Dreams, she was unequaled, even by Lanfear.{x
{rWhile she most certainly could never have equaled Lanfear in the waking{x
{rworld, in Tel'aran'rhiod Moghedien could have bettered the Daughter of the{x
{rNight.  {w {x

{RRahvin{x
 
{rVery little is known of Rahvin, both before the Collapse or when he became{x
{rone of the Chosen.  What is known was that his real name was Ared Mosinel. {x
{rUnder the Shadow he held both military commands and political office and{x
{ralthough he was a fair general, his talent was for political and diplomatic{x
{raffairs.  Rahvin's major weakness was his fondness for women and was also{x
{rsusceptible to flattery.  People frequently rose quickly in his{x
{radministration by flattering him although he was quick to remove people who{x
{rwere too unsuited for their duties.  One thing which is known for certain{x
{rabout Rahvin is that he had a tendency to use Compulsion.  {w {x

{RSammael{x
 
{rTel Janin Aellinsar was a world renowned sportsman, and was a good friend of{x
{rLews Therin Telamon.  He was one of Lews Therin's best generals, and quickly{x
{rfell in love with war.  Most likely it was the honors and special privileges{x
{rwhich came with being a high ranking officer which he enjoyed the most.  Tel{x
{rJanin was always at his best when he was on the defensive, and the forces{x
{ropposing the Shadow were often on the defensive.  {x
 
{rHe considered himself a much better general than the Dragon, and resented{x
{rthe fact that Lews Therin had received the overall command of the forces{x
{ropposing the Shadow over himself.  Suddenly, during the middle of the war,{x
{rhe turned to the Dark One.  Sammael believed that the forces of the Shadow{x
{rwould inevitably win; he also had a very deep hatred of Lews Therin.  {x
 
{rSammael wore a deep scar which was given him by Lews Therin.  While such a{x
{rscar could have easily been Restored (Healed) during the Age of Legends, he{x
{rchose not to.  Sammael was determined to wear it until he had defeated the{x
{rDragon.  As a governor of conquered territories, his administrations were{x
{rterrible.  He paid no attention to the general population, and hunger and{x
{rdisease were commonplace.  His armies, on the other hand, were well fed and{x
{rtaken care of.  He did not want his armies to let him down when it was{x
{rimportant they perform well.  {w {x

{RSemirhage{x
 
{rInitially known as Nemene Damendar Boann, the woman to be called Semirhage{x
{rwas as well known for healing the body as Graendal was at healing the mind. {x
{rShe was frequently summoned to places all across the world to Heal people{x
{rwho were out of the reach of most every other Aes Sedai in the world.  In{x
{raddition to being a Restorer, though, Nemene was also a sadist.  In return{x
{rfor Healing her patients, she also gave them all a great deal of pain.  Few{x
{rcomplained, as pain was a small price to pay for still being alive.  When{x
{rthe Hall of the Servants discovered what she was doing, they gave her two{x
{rchoices.  One was to be bound with the Power against doing violence, the{x
{rother to be severed from the True Source.  Given those two options, she{x
{rchose a third - swearing to the Dark One at Shayol Ghul.  {x
 
{rSemirhage spent some time serving as both a general and a governor for the{x
{rShadow.  Her reigns over conquered territory were particularly of a{x
{rparticularly violent nature, even for one of the Forsaken.  It was Semirhage{x
{rthat discovered that a circle of thirteen, with thirteen Myrddraal, could{x
{rturn an Aes Sedai to the Shadow against his or her will. {x

{RTrollocs{x
 
{rTrollocs were initially created before the War of the Shadow when the Dark{x
{rOne was in need of soldiers.  Scientists loyal to the Shadow, chief among{x
{rthem Aginor blended the genetic material of humans and naturally aggressive{x
{ranimals such as bears, boars, wolves, goats, wildcats, rams and eagles.  The{x
{rresulting man-beasts, each with a face and characteristics of the particular{x
{ranimal it was crafted from were called Trollocs.  {x
 
{rTrollocs are large and power creatures approximately eight to ten feet in{x
{rheight with the body of an overlarge, extremely muscular man.  They are{x
{rstronger than either the human or the animal of their heritage.  They are{x
{romnivorous and will eat any kind of meat, including human flesh and the{x
{rflesh of other Trollocs.  Initially, however, the Trollocs were a failure in{x
{rterms of a potential soldier.  A lack of discipline and ability to take{x
{rorders, as well as a lazy and deceitful nature, prevented them from becoming{x
{rthe effective warriors the Dreadlords had hoped to create.  {x
 
{rTrollocs organized themselves into tribes, and are the only creations from{x
{rthe War of Power to have an organized social structure.  The chief tribes{x
{rare Ahf'frait, Al'ghol, Bhan'seen, Dha'vol, Dhai'mon, Dhjin'nen, Ghar'ghael,{x
{rGhob'hlin, Gho'hlem, Ghraem'lan, Ko'bol and the Kno'mon.  {x
 
{rOnly the males fight, with the females doing little but serving as breeding{x
{rmachines.  The Trollocs do not always breed true.  Sometimes throwbacks to{x
{rthe animal side are born, which die quickly.  Throwbacks to the human side,{x
{rcalled Myrddraal, usually survive. {x
~
E
page_02~
{RMyrddraal{x
 
{rMyrddraals were not at first intentionally created, instead they were the{x
{rtwisted offspring of Trollocs in which the human stock used in the creation{x
{rof the Trollocs has resurfaced but tainted by the evil used to create the{x
{rTrollocs.  They have tall, muscular bodies, and move with a serpent's speed{x
{rand grace.  Their skin is a pale white, and a Myrddraal could almost be{x
{rmistaken for a man except for the lack of eyes.  However, this lack does not{x
{rhinder them - they see like eagles in even the deepest night.  {x
 
{rThe Myrddraal are able to disappear wherever shadows exist, and move to{x
{ranother shadow far away.  None understand how this is done.  Aginor believed{x
{rthat the Fades might be slightly shifted out of phase with reality.  Halfmen{x
{rappear as misty blurs in a mirror, and their dead black cloaks are not{x
{rtouched by even the strongest wind.  Their only known weakness is running{x
{rwater, which will cause an end to any casual pursuit.  {x
 
{rThe eyeless gaze of a Fade inspires paralyzing fear in even the bravest of{x
{rwarriors.  It is this ability to cause fear which makes them excellent{x
{rcommanders of Trollocs.  In addition, the Myrddraal have the ability to link{x
{rwith a number of Trollocs, taking control of their minds and wills. {x
{rHowever, the death of this Myrddraal means the simultaneous deaths of all{x
{rthe Trollocs it is linked to.  {x
 
{rThe Myrddraal do not use the same crude weapons and armor as their Trolloc{x
{rparents.  Instead, they wear black plate armor, which enhances their{x
{rserpent-like appearance.  The Halfmen wield swords made at Thakan'dar, near{x
{rthe entrance to the Pit of Doom.  Each sword is quenched in the tainted{x
{rstreams of Shayol Ghul and seasoned with a human soul.  A wound inflicted by{x
{rone of these blades always proves fatal unless the One Power is used to Heal{x
{rthe victim.  {x
 
{rThe Myrddraal are known by many names, among them Shadowmen, Halfmen, Lurk,{x
{rthe Eyeless, Fades, and Neverborn.{x
~
E
page_03~
{RDraghkar{x
 
{rLike Trollocs, the Draghkar were deliberate creations incorporating the{x
{rcorruption of human stock.  A Draghkar looks a great deal like an overly{x
{rtall man but their eyes are too large, and their skin too pale.  The{x
{rDraghkar appear to be wrapped in a black cloak, but this cloak is actually a{x
{rpair of bat-like wings.  {x
 
{rUnlike the Myrddraal and Trollocs, the Draghkar have little in the way of{x
{rfighting ability due to their frail nature.  Instead, the Draghkar use their{x
{rsoft, hypnotic song to draw their prey to them.  Once the Draghkar have{x
{rtheir prey, they "kiss" them, slowly draining away the person's soul.  After{x
{rthe soul has been devoured, the Draghkar then drains away life as well.  {x
 
{rPeople rescued from the clutches of a Draghkar are lifeless shells, with no{x
{rsoul or personality left to them.  Once a Draghkar has a hold of someone, it{x
{ris probably best to let the Draghkar finish its work.  {x
 
{rUsing their wings, the Draghkar are capable of flight so are used primarily{x
{ras outdoor assassins when their targets are alone.  They are less effective{x
{ras indoor or daylight assassins as they have a great difficulty gaining{x
{raccess into sealed areas or dealing with groups of people or sunlight.{x
~
E
page_04~
{RGray Men{x
 
{rUnlike other Shadowspawn, Gray Men are not constructs.  Instead, they are{x
{rmen and women who did not mere pledge their souls to the Shadow as{x
{rDarkfriends did, they actually given their souls to the Dark One also{x
{rearning them the name of "Soulless".  {x
 
{rThey are effective assassins as somehow this lack of a soul makes them seem{x
{rvery ordinary and difficult to notice in a crowd.  Oftentimes the victim{x
{rnever sees them coming.  There have even been instances where a Gray Man{x
{rkilling someone in a crowd was never even noticed.  Even the most vigilant{x
{rof defenders can fail to notice a Gray Man, which would explain why they are{x
{rfrequently used to attack important targets.  The Gray Men could be{x
{rconsidered the most dangerous of the Dark One's assassins.  {x
 
{rIt is unknown what causes these men and women to give their souls to the{x
{rGreat Lord of the Dark, as opposed to merely pledging to the Shadow as{x
{rtypical Darkfriends do.  However, the number of Gray Men suggests that the{x
{rrewards for this sacrifice must be great indeed.  {w {x
~
E
page_05~
{RDarkhounds{x
 
{rNot all of the Shadowspawn were designed to with human features.  Darkhounds{x
{rwere created using canine stock, possibly wolves, corrupted by the Shadow. {x
{rThe Darkhounds' only resemblance to a normal hound is the general shape. {x
{rDarkhounds are darker than the night and as large as a pony.  They were{x
{rinitially created as guard beasts during the War of Power.  Later, they were{x
{rlater used to hunt down the Dark One's enemies.  {x
 
{rIt is possible that much like the Myrddraal, the Darkhounds were slightly{x
{rshifted out of reality in their creation.  They leave no mark on even the{x
{rsoftest ground, yet leave footprints in the hardest stone.  Often the smell{x
{rof burning sulphur accompanies them.  Both the blood and saliva of a{x
{rDarkhound is highly toxic, toxic enough to cause a slow and agonizing death{x
{rwith one drop on the skin.  {x
 
{rDarkhounds do not easily give up on a trail once on it.  The Darkhounds{x
{rdislike rain and thunderstorms, but this will not stop them once on the{x
{rtrail of their quarry.  They are faster than horses, and can maintain their{x
{rspeed longer than even the strongest horse.  Once a Darkhound is on the{x
{rtrail, the only choice is to turn and kill it, or be killed.  {x
 
{rThe only way to escape a Darkhound is to cross over running water -{x
{rDarkhounds do not like rain or thunderstorms and will not usually venture{x
{rinto them.  They also refuse to cross flowing water of any kind.  Darkhounds{x
{rare among the most tenacious servants of the Shadow, simply not giving up{x
{rwhile they still breathe.  {w {x
~
E
page_06~
{RGholam{x
 
{rLittle information in the historical records remains about the Gholam apart{x
{rfrom that they most dangerous of all of Shadowspawn.  {x
 
{rThe gholam were created by the Forsaken for one reason- to kill Aes Sedai. {x
{rOnly created six, because even the Forsaken feared the danger the gholam{x
{rpresented.  Three of these gholam were created in the forms of women, three{x
{rin the forms of men.  {x
 
{rThe gholam are dangerous because they are immune to the One Power.  Weaves{x
{rof the Power directed toward a gholam simply flow around them.  The danger{x
{rthey present to Aes Sedai is obvious.  Stripped of their most potent{x
{rdefense, an Aes Sedai would be vulnerable to a physical attack.  {x
 
{rBut the gholam are dangerous in other ways.  They are fast, strong, and{x
{rcunning.  They are also flexible, able to slip under a doorway.  It would be{x
{rnearly impossible to defeat them in single combat, as normal weapons do not{x
{rseem to hurt them in any manner.  {x
 
{rIt was generally thought that they were all destroyed or lost during the War{x
{rof Power or the Breaking of the World.  {w {x
~
E
page_07~
{RJumara{x
 
{rLike Gholam, little information in the historical records remains about the{x
{rJumara.  A jumara is a worm-like Shadowspawn created by Aginor during the{x
{rWar of Power, jumaras are one of the least known and perhaps one of the most{x
{rdangerous Shadowspawn ever made.  Their presence is familiar in the{x
{rBorderlands, where they are called Worms.  No jumara has been seen outside{x
{rof the Blight in recent times.  Their rarity is a blessing for the people of{x
{rthe world.  A single jumara is said to be able to easily kill a Fade.  Worse{x
{rstill, they travel in packs. {x

Lugard Road~
Here lies a long dirt road that has been worn down and rutted from years
of use by carts and wagons.  The road winds its way through relatively flat
open grass lands; although there appears to be a small village along the
road on the western horizon there are signs of human life which are much
closer from here to the east.  Along the road to the east there appears to
be stone docks that have been built along the bank of a great river.  There
are also a few gray stone buildings that have been constructed near to these
docks but there are many more similar looking structures built on the
opposite side of the waterway.

Lugard Road~
Lugard Road finally ends a short distance away to the east at a set of
stone docks.  The docks overlook a huge waterway known as the River
Manetherendrelle; the only way of crossing the river appears to be the
ferries that can be seen dotted about the river.  A bigger set of stone
docks can be seen on the opposite bank of the river with cargo barges and
boats in addition to the ferries moving around them.  None of the gray stone
buildings on this side of the river are taller than two stories unlike the
much bigger ones on the opposite side, but both sets of buildings have roofs
covered in brightly colored tiles that range from golden yellow to deep
purple.

A Stone Dock~
This is a large dock that has been constructed from gray stone.  The dock
juts out into the River Manetherendrelle, which at this point along the
enormous waterway is at least half a mile in width.  On the opposite side of
the great river to the east similar stone docks have been built, in fact the
docks look busy with the river traffic with both river barges, and oared
ferries.  From the dock on this side of the river there is a rough track
which has been formed by many years of wear from wagons and carts leading
westwards between a series of small gray stone buildings.  There are only a
few buildings to be seen on this side of the river, far less than those that
can be seen built on the eastern side.

{cThe River Manetherendrelle{x~
The waters of the River Manetherendrelle have taken on a dull grayish
tone as strong currents stir up silt; the murkiness of the waters makes any
estimation to the true depth of the river by sight alone almost impossible. 
There are many riverboats to be seen along the river from large slow moving
river barges heavily laden with their cargoes to the much faster and smaller
ferries propelled by many wooden oars that make the boats look like insects
sliding across the surface of the water.  A large settlement and a set of
docks have been built along the east side of the river.  There are a few
gray stone buildings on the west side of the river beside some docks
although these ones appear to be used mainly by the ferries that cross the
Manetherendrelle.

{cThe River Manetherendrelle{x~
Through the dull and murky depths of the River Manetherendrelle are small
dark silhouettes darting around, probably of fish swimming around in the
water.  The water is so murky from silt being swept along by the current of
the river that it is very difficult to see how deep the water truly is.  At
this point along the waterway two sets of docks have been built on both of
the riverbanks.  The docks on the east bank are much larger and busier with
river bound traffic than the one on the opposite bank.  Beyond the docks on
the eastern side of the river there are many gray stone buildings to be
seen, all of them have brightly colored tiled roofs ranging from deep red,
to golden yellow and even violet.

{cThe River Manetherendrelle{x~
The middle of the River Manetherendrelle provides a good spot to view the
stone docks built on each side of the river.  There are a lot of river craft
to be seen along the busy waterway, most of the traffic appears to go
through the larger set of docks on the east bank.  Beyond the docks are tall
warehouses, each one constructed from gray stone.  More gray stone buildings
are visible beyond the warehouses; most of these buildings' roofs have been
covered with brightly colored tiles.  The docks on the west bank appear to
be reserved for the many oared ferries that cross the river.  A scatter of
gray stone buildings can also be seen along the western side of the river
but are much smaller than the ones on the opposite side of the river.

{cThe River Manetherendrelle{x~
Silt and small debris from up stream that has been churned up by the
river currents make the waters of the River Manetherendrelle quite dark and
murky.  The small dark silhouettes of fish can be seen darting around within
the almost translucent depths of the water.  A much more impressive view
than of partially visible fish can be seen upon the surface of the water,
large river craft as well as smaller and nimbler ferries can be seen as they
make their way along the river.  There are two sets of docks to be seen at
this point along the river; on the eastern side of the river is a large set
of docks built on the edge of a small town.  There is a much smaller set of
docks on the western bank that seems to be reserved for ferries.

{cThe River Manetherendrelle{x~
Numerous cargo boats and ferries glide gracefully across the surface of
the immense body of water known as the River Manetherendrelle.  The water
here is almost translucent, an effect created by silt and debris being
churned up by the strong river current.  The river itself is roughly half a
mile in width at this point where two sets of stone docks have been built,
one on each riverbank.  The docks on the western side of the river appear to
be small, just a stopping point for the ferries that cross the river.  The
docks built upon the eastern bank are much bigger; they appear to be where
the majority of the river traffic stops off.  Beyond these docks a small
town has been built, many comprised of tall gray stone buildings toped with
colorfully tiled roofs.

A Stone Dock~
This is a large dock that has been constructed from rough gray stone, the
same type of stone that has been used to pave the streets that run through
the area of docks.  One such street can be seen to the east, both it and the
dock is overlooked by tall gray stone warehouses constructed on the eastern
side of the street.  The dock itself extends out into the River
Manetherendrelle where at this point along the massive waterway is at least
half a mile in width, along the opposite side of the river a second, much
smaller set of docks has been built.  There are many different types of
river craft to be seen upon the grayish waters of the Manetherendrelle
including cargo boats and ferries.

Lugard Road~
Not only is the Lugard Road is the main thoroughfare that leads east/west
through the little town of Remen, it is also part of the main trade route
from Altara to Murandy.  The Lugard Road does not appear to be the only road
in the town that has been paved in gray stone, there is a second road
leading north/south through the dock area of the town that has also been
paved.  On the eastern side of that road there are tall gray stone
warehouses that have been roofed in the same brightly colored tiles as many
of the other buildings of the town.  These warehouses overlook the stone
docks that have been built upon the western side of the road; the docks in
turn overlook a huge gray river to the west.

Murandy.  The town is very unusual for its size; all of the roads have been
paved with gray stone instead of being left as bare dirt.  The town is in
Altara, the style of building here contrasts greatly from the towns and
cities in the south; these gray stone buildings would not seem too much out
of place in Murandy or even some parts of Andor.  There is one major
difference though as the roofs of the buildings are covered in brightly
colored tiles ranging from golden yellow to red and even purple; if the town
was viewed from above it would probably look like a gleeman's patched cloak.

Lugard Road~
The Lugard Road is the main road that leads through Remen and forms part
of the main trade route from Altara to Murandy.  This is a particularly
noisy section of the town with the racket of the river docks to the west
being clearly heard over the noise in the street.  This small town is very
unusual for its size for all its roads have been paved with gray stone
instead of being left as bare dirt.  The style of building here in the north
of Altara contrasts greatly from the towns and cities in the south; these
gray stone buildings would not seem too much out of place in parts of
Murandy or Andor.  Each of the buildings along this road has a steeply
sloping roof which has been covered in brightly colored tiles; the colors
range from golden yellow and bright red to deep purple.

Lugard Road~
The Lugard Road is the main thoroughfare that leads east/west through the
town of Remen and forms part of the main trade route from Altara to Murandy.
The street is quite broad and has been paved using gray stone blocks, the
same type of stone used in the construction of many of the shops and houses
in the town.  The style of building here in Remen contrasts greatly from the
towns and cities in the south of Altara; the buildings would not seem too
much out of place in Andor or even some parts of Murandy.  Each of the
buildings along this road has a steeply sloping roof that has been covered
in brightly colored tiles; the colors range from yellow to violet.  At this
point along the long thoroughfare is a narrow alley that cuts through the
row of buildings on the northern side of the street.

The Town Square~
The town square marks the center of Remen and is a gathering for both
citizens and travelers alike.  A few peddlers and traders can be seen
amongst the throng of people in the square, their shouts clearly audible
over the general din.  The square itself is a rather large area paved with
gray stone blocks with several broad paved streets arranged haphazardly
around the square.  Over the years the gray stone used to pave the square
has become worn and rutted in some areas, cracked and broken in others.  The
square is overlooked from all sides by tall gray stone buildings, mainly
houses; their colorfully tiled roofs make the town look like a gleeman's
patched cloak.

Lugard Road~
The Lugard Road is the primary thoroughfare that leads east/west through
the little town of Remen and forms part of the main trade route from Altara
to Murandy.  Tall gray stone buildings, mainly shops and houses, surround
the road although there are much larger buildings that can be seen in the
far distance to the west; these appear to be warehouses.  The town is very
peculiar for its size; all of the town's roads have been paved with gray
stone instead of being left as bare dirt.  There is a large paved area that
can be seen just a short distance away to the west and appears to bisect the
long thoroughfare.  Also seen at this point along the Lugard Road is a
second street that leads northwards away from the center of the town.

Lugard Road~
The Lugard Road is the main thoroughfare that leads through the center of
Remen.  This is a noisy part of town with the racket of the nearby river
docks almost drowning out the noises in the street.  This small town is very
unusual due to the fact that all of the roads are paved with gray stone
instead of being left as bare dirt.  The buildings that make up the town are
constructed from gray stone and would not seem too much out of place in
Murandy or even some parts of Andor.  Each of the buildings along this road
has a steeply sloping roof which has been covered in brightly colored tiles;
the colors range from golden yellow and bright red to deep purple.  Although
there are mainly houses built along this road there are a few shops and even
the odd tavern or two.

Lugard Road~
This is the eastern edge of Remen, a small town situated in northern
Altara by the River Manetherendrelle.  The town lies on the Lugard Road, the
main trade route from Altara to Murandy.  This town is very unusual for its
size for almost all of the roads within it are paved using gray stone blocks
instead of being left bare mud.  This part of the Lugard Road is flanked by
gray stone buildings; mainly houses can be seen although in the distance to
the far west large warehouses have been built beside the docks.  Many of the
buildings in this town have steeply sloping roofs that have been covered
with colored tiles, the colors of the tiled roofs range from yellow to
purple.

The Docks of Remen~
Remen would be a dull town made up of buildings and paved streets made of
gray stone if it were not for the roofs of the building that have been
covered in colorful tiles.  Even the docks that lie along the western side
of this particular street have been constructed from dull gray stone and to
some would make a dreary sight against the murky waters of the River
Manetherendrelle.  The only color there is the colorfully painted boats that
are moored or are on the move along the river.  Along the eastern side of
this particular street are a few tall warehouses that are used for storing
cargo from the docks and dotted in between some of the warehouses there a
few smaller buildings that look like shops.

The Docks of Remen~
This is a long paved road that runs along the docks of Remen which are
perhaps one of the busiest districts within the town.  From this point a
multitude of river bound craft can be seen to nearby to the west, either
moored or moving along the River Manetherendrelle.  Traveling between the
boats moored at the stone docks and the tall gray stone warehouses on the
eastern side of this paved street are numerous dock workers and sailors
working day and night to move cargo to and from the boats.  This place looks
like it is an accident waiting to happen as some of the workers narrowly
avoid being hit by horse and oxen driven carts traveling along this
dangerous and overcrowded thoroughfare.

The Docks of Remen~
There are tall dark gray warehouses built within this district of Remen
that loom eerily over the paved streets below them.  Along the opposite side
of this particular road some docks can be seen that have been constructed
also from gray stone and jut out into the murky waters of the
Manetherendrelle.  Color is brought into this little gray town by brightly
colored tiled roofs that are seen in abundance on the buildings, the vibrant
hues range from golden yellow to deep reds and purples; to some the town is
very reminiscent to a gleeman's patched cloak.

The Docks of Remen~
The docks are one of the busiest parts of the little town of Remen. 
There is a lot of traffic to be seen within this district of the town; most
of it is comprised of heavy carts and wagons laden with goods that are
either being transported on to or off of the cargo boats moored at the
docks.  Along the eastern side of this wide paved street are tall warehouses
that are probably used as storage facilities for certain cargoes.  There are
also a few shabby looking shops built beside the thoroughfare.  A much
narrower paved street can be seen here leading away from the docks to the
east towards the heart of the town.

This is the western end of Crane Street, a long and narrow road that
leads east/west through the southern part of the little town of Remen.  The
road has been paved with dull gray stone that has been worn down in places
by heavy carts and wagons.  On either side of the road there are tall
buildings made from the same gray stone as the road.  There are mostly
houses built along this road but all of the buildings are roofed in brightly
colored tiles.  To the west Crane Street connects with another, much wider
paved road that leads through the dock area of the town by the river.

This street paved with gray stone provides a good view of the bright and
vivid colors of painted river vessels to the west that contrast greatly
against the murky waters of the River Manetherendrelle on which they rest
upon.  At this point along the vast waterway the river has lost most of the
ferocity it is noted for having although the almost translucent waters may
still hold hidden dangers in their depths.  Stone docks have been
constructed along the riverbank which takes advantage of the calm waters
here.  Goods in crates, baskets, barrels and bundles can also be seen being
transported by dockworkers between the boats and tall gray stone warehouses
that have been built along the eastern side of this street opposite the
docks.

river-bound vessels to be seen here either moored at the docks or moving
across the water's surface ranging from large cargo boats to smaller oared
ferries.  Overlooking both the docks and this road are several tall
warehouses built along the eastern side of the road; they are large gray
stone buildings topped with brightly colored tiled roofs that look similar
to the shops and houses built within the town.

This is a large stable yard that lies wedged between two buildings.  A
wide muddy track leads southwards away from the yard to a wide paved road. 
Placed along the east side of the yard is a long wooden railing and a large
water trough.  Beyond the railing is the stable built from wood and gray
stone and roofed with deep violet tiles that are similar to the ones used to
roof the second building on the opposite side of the yard.  The second gray
stone building is roughly three stories in height and forms an "l" shape
along the western and northern edges of the yard.  There are two entrances
into the building, a small plain wooden door to the north and a second door
to the west that is marked out by a rather garishly painted sign hanging

east/west through the northern end of Remen.  The road is showing signs of
wear and tear, there are shallow ruts etched into the road's surface which
have probably been created by the heavy carts and wagons that use it.  Gray
stone houses with colorfully tiled roofs overlook this busy thoroughfare;
some of the buildings have been decorated with hanging baskets and window
boxes containing exquisite floral arrangements.  At this point along Heron
Street is a second street that leads southwards towards the center of the
town.

Heron Street~
Heron Street is a broad street paved with gray stone blocks that runs
east/west thorough the northern end of Remen.  Over the years the gray stone
used to pave the street has become worn and rutted in some areas, cracked
and broken in others.  There are many gray stone houses built in this area
of the town all crowded together in neat rows along each side of the road. 
Each building along this road has a steeply sloping roof that has been
covered in brightly colored tiles; the colors range from golden yellow and
bright red to deep purple.  Some of the larger and more elegant houses have
been decorated with hanging baskets and window boxes containing beautiful
floral arrangements adding color to this primarily drab and gray area.

Heron Street~
This is the eastern end of Heron Street, a long road that leads east/west
through the northern part of Remen.  Over the years the gray stone used to
pave the street has become worn and rutted in some areas, cracked and broken
in others.  Houses constructed from the same gray stone as the street
overlook this busy thoroughfare; some of the buildings have been decorated
with hanging baskets and window boxes containing exquisite floral
arrangements.  There are also a few shops and taverns to be seen along this
road, their colorfully painted signs marking them out from the other
buildings.  There is a narrow archway made of gray stone at the end of the
street, beyond the arch lies a large square courtyard.

Owl Street~
This is the northern end of Owl Street, a short thoroughfare that runs
north/south through the northern part of Remen.  The street has been paved
with gray stone blocks, which is the same type of stone that has been used
in the construction of many of the buildings in the town.  There are mainly
shops built beside Owl Street, each one crowned with a steeply sloping roof
that has been covered in brightly colored tiles and are marked out from the
relatively more duller buildings by colorfully painted signs hung over their
entrances.  To the north Owl Street intersects a second street that runs
along the northern edge of the town.

Owl Street~
Owl Street is one of Remen's many broad streets paved with gray stone. 
There are mainly shops and taverns built beside Owl Street, each one has
been constructed from dull gray stone and topped with a sloping roof.  The
shops are clearly distinguished from the other buildings along this road by
colorfully painted signs hung over their entrances.  Apart from the shop
signs, this street would be dull if it were not for the bright colorful
roofs of the buildings; the colors of the tiles used in the construction of
the roofs of the buildings along Owl Street range from bright yellow to deep
purple.  Also seen at this point along Owl Street is a narrow alley that
cuts through the row of houses on the western side of the street.

A Stone Dock~
This is a large dock that has been constructed from rough gray stone.  It
overlooks similar stone docks that jut out into the murky gray waters of a
huge river.  A long street running north/south through the area links each
jetty to each other, the street is paved in the same gray stone the docks
have been constructed from.  Like the other docks, this one is a hive of
activity mainly with sailors and dockworkers hard at work loading and
unloading cargo from the boats moored here.  There are many other boats to
be seen upon the river including simple cargo barges and even a few ferries
that crosses the vast expanse of water.

other docks, this one is a hive of activity mainly with sailors and
dockworkers hard at work loading and unloading cargo from the boats here. 
Across the grayish waters of the Manetherendrelle to the west a smaller set
of docks can be seen, they appear to be used mainly by the ferries that
cross the river rather than cargo boats.

This is one of a few large gray stone buildings that are being used as
warehouses along the western edge of Remen.  The rush torches that have been
fixed to the walls to light the area have left thick sooty marks upon the
stone walls.  This particular warehouse has been used to hold numerous large
bolts of colorful cloths, a startling contrast to the gray gloomy tones of
the storage room.  There is also a large pile of small wooden casks lurking
in one corner of the storage room that are clearly mark as holding dyes.

The area is heavy with dust and thick cobwebs hang like drapes from the
wooden support beams of the gloomy building.  Smoky rush torches that have
been fixed to the walls illuminate the area leaving thick sooty stains to
mar the area of wall behind each torch.  Numerous large wooden barrels and
chests have been stacked neatly against the interior walls of this
warehouse; each container branded with the mark of its corresponding owner. 
There is a faint squeaking noise that can be heard from within the shadows
cast by the rush torches suggesting that rodents have set up residence in
this storage area.

The Market Square~
The market square is probably one of the most colorful and noisiest areas
of Remen and the northwestern corner of the square is no exception.  The
square is a large area that is overlooked by tall buildings that consist
mainly of shops and houses, constructed from the same type of stone used to
pave the area.  The color within this area comes from the brilliantly
colored canvas awnings of the market stalls that populate the area and the
merchandise displayed within them.  The air is thick with the almost
overpowering aromas of food, rich exotic spices and fragrant perfumes
emanating from some of the market stalls.  Almost hidden by the crowds
gathered here is a short paved road that cuts northwards between the
buildings that surround the market square.

The market square is probably one of the most colorful and noisiest areas

dozens of market stalls within this section of the market; each one

weird yet wonderful wares.  The air is thick with the aromas of food, rich
exotic spices and fragrant perfumes emanating from some of the market
stalls.  There are tall warehouses made of gray stone that can be seen
behind the shops and houses that line the western side of the square
although there does not appear to be a direct route to the warehouses from
this point in the town.

The market is probably one of the most noisiest and colorful parts of
Remen.  The market is situated in a large paved area that is flanked by tall
buildings.  The color comes from the brightly colored awnings of the market
stalls that populate the area and their merchandise displayed within them. 
The stalls in this area of the market mostly belong to clothiers, their
vivid displays of dyed cloths, silks and wool add to the already colorful
show of the market.  The din of peddlers hawking their goods and the general
chatter of shoppers as they browse through the stalls fills the air.  Almost
hidden by the crowds gathered here are two narrow alleys that cut between
the buildings that surround the square, one leads eastwards whilst the other
one leads southwards.

fill the air from braziers, almost overpowering the sweet perfumes and
exotic spices from the other stalls.  Shoppers, both locals and strangers
alike, weave their way through the stalls accompanied by the shouts of the
traders.

Osprey Lane~
Osprey Lane is a short and narrow walkway that leads between a tightly
packed group of tall gray stone buildings that mainly consist of shops and
houses.  Despite this length of this lane, it has been paved with small
blocks of gray stone although some of the paving has become loose over time
allowing patches of weeds to poke their way through to the surface.  The
tall buildings that flank this lane cast eerie shadows making the alley the
perfect place for an ambush.  To the east Osprey Lane intersects a broad
street that goes north/south.  The ordinary sounds of that busy street are
overpowered by din created by the crowds of people which can be heard to the
west where large market square can be seen.

shadows that probably hide a multitude of sins within their cloak of
darkness.  To the south Finch Lane intersects a broad street that runs

street are overpowered by din of crowds of people that can be heard to the
north where a large market square is visible.

Despite the images the name Swan Lane may conjure in one's mind, the lane
is nothing but a muddy path flanked by two rows of tightly packed tall
buildings constructed from gray stone.  Most of the area is shrouded in the
shadows cast by the buildings which make the alley the perfect place for an
ambush.  There are a few small pools of light that manage to reach the
ground to reveal the trash and debris littering the muddy path.  Apart from
attempting to scale the smooth stone walls of these buildings to reach the
arched windows that overlook the alley, the only entrances into these
buildings appear to be some battered wooden doors.  To the west, Swan Lane
joins a wide paved street that runs north/south through the southern half of
Remen.

The lane is strewn with trash and debris and is probably a haven to stray
scavenging animals such as rats and dogs.  Strung high above the lane
between the tall buildings are numerous washing lines, and upon each line
are numerous items of damp laundry that have been left to dry like bunting. 
To the east at the end of the lane there is a narrow archway made of gray
stone, beyond the arch lies a large square courtyard.

end of Kingfisher Lane is marked clearly by a tall gray stone wall,
approximately eight feet in height.

{BThe Boatwright's Yard{x~
This is a large yard built on the outskirts of Remen upon the eastern
bank of the River Manetherendrelle.  The area has been left bare mud and
gravel, a striking contrasted to the paved streets that run through the
town.  There are two buildings on the southern side of the yard; one is a
large cabin constructed from logs and gray stone.  The second building
appears to be no more than a roofed shelter used to store timber and large
wooden barrels and crates.  The dominant feature of this place is the
partially constructed cargo barge that sits inside a large dry dock at the
center of the yard.  Next to the dry dock is a large a-frame hoist that is
probably used to move the heavier goods and materials needed for the
construction of boats.

flickering light cast eerie shadows.  At the south end of the common room is
a large window that looks out over the River Manetherendrelle and the
brightly painted boats upon it.  On the east side of the room is a rather
large wooden door above which a "lucky" horseshoe hangs from a loose rusty
nail and seems poised to fall at any moment.  A second doorway leading out
of the common room can be seen at the north side of the room.

The Three Crowns Inn is one of the larger inns within Remen.  This is the
western half of the common room, which is a long rectangular shaped room
whose bare wooden floorboards have been darkened from years of accumulating
dirt and grime.  At west end of the common room is a large gray stone
fireplace with a few horse brasses hung above the mantelpiece for
decoration.  At the south side of the room is a large window that overlooks
the river docks of Remen, which to some is a gray and gloomy sight to
behold.  Placed at the north end of the room is a large bar with a few
shelves fixed to the wall behind it.  Finally a small wooden door can be
seen behind the bar to the north which is a convenient exit out of this

This is the east end of the common room of the Wayman's Forge, one of
Remen's largest inns.  Built from dull gray stone this building is
illuminated by large windows by day and by brass lanterns hung upon the wall
by night.  The floor is left bare wood apart from a rough piece of matting
placed at the foot of a large arched scroll-carved door at the north side of
the room.  There is a second, much smaller doorway on the east end of the
room from which the aroma of cooking food seems to be emanating from.  There
are many tables and chairs neatly arranged in the room but the main focal
point is the steep wooden staircase that has been built along the south side
of the room, which leads to the upper levels of the inn.

The Blue Lion is a rundown hovel of a tavern located in Remen.  This is
the common room, a large rectangular room with much its gray stone walls and
floorboards are covered in dirt and grime.  At the east end of the room is
the bar with numerous shelves filled with bottles and tankards fixed to the
wall behind the counter.  On the west side of the room is a large fireplace
made of gray stone with a large banner depicting a blue lion on a field of
white hanging above the mantelpiece.  There are several doors that lead out
of the common room but the most prominent exits are on the north and south
sides of the room, both exits have been built next to large windows although
their crown glass panes makes it difficult to determine what lies outside.

This is the northern end of a huge shop that appears to sell both weapons
and armor.  Like the majority of the buildings within Remen this building
has been produced from dull gray stone with additional support from thick
wooden timbers.  This particular shop has been split into two by a tall
wooden counter running lengthways down the room.  Hung upon the west wall
behind the counter in display cases are numerous high quality weapons, all
of which are polished until gleaming.  At the opposite side of the room
there is a large window that overlooks a long paved street; at the opposite
side of the street more shops and houses can be seen.  Next to the window
there is a scroll carved door that obviously is an exit leading onto the

that makes up the town of Remen.  This particular room appears to be a
study; the floor of the room is covered in a thick gray woolen carpet and
brass lanterns hung upon the gray stone walls dimly illuminate the room
itself.  Hung upon the walls are various paintings and charts, mainly of
plants and flowers, each one has a simple wooden frame.  A steep wooden
staircase built along the southern wall of the room leads to the upper level
of the house.  There are several wooden doorways marking exits out of this
particular room but the most noticeable one is a large door on the eastern

Gray stone has been used throughout this rather dull and dismal kitchen. 
The floor of this room has been tiled in smooth gray stone that is almost
freezing to touch.  The main heat source within this room is the large stone
fireplace built on the northern side of the room.  Hung over the fireplace
is a large spit as well as a blackened iron pot containing some strange
bubbling mixture.  Built next to the main fireplace is a black iron stove. 
The kitchen is a mass of wooden cupboards, drawers and stone work tops,
everything within this room looks like it has been recently scrubbed clean. 
There appear to be two exits out of this room, a large wooden door to the
south and a much flimsier door to the west.

This is a long and narrow passageway located somewhere within the Three
Crowns Inn.  There does not appear to be anything unusual here at a first
glance, the floor and walls of this area have been left almost bare wood and
stone and only a couple of ornate lanterns hung from the walls seem to
provide any decoration here.  The lanterns also provide light within this
area, despite being dull and leaving much of the corridor hidden within the
shadows.  There are several doorways along the corridor that lead into other
parts of the inn, one in particular on the southern side of the passageway
seems to be the source for a strong odor of tabac smoke and stale ale.

There does not appear to be anything out of the ordinary about this
hallway, it is just a plain and simple passageway that runs through the
Three Crowns Inn.  The floor and walls of this area have been left almost
bare; only a couple of ornate lanterns hung from the walls seem to provide
any decoration here.  The lanterns barely illuminate this place; they
emanate a dull yellow glow and cast strange and eerie shadows about the
place.  The pale golden light of the lanterns does reveal several doorways
along the corridor that lead into other parts of the inn.  One noticeable
feature about this section of the hallway is the very steep and narrow
wooden staircase that has been built here; the stairs leads upwards although
where it leads to is hidden in darkness.

a small bed, complete with a comfy patchwork quilt spread upon it.  Fixed
precariously high above the bed is a wooden shelf which appears to be the
home of several small books and ornaments.  There is a door on the southern

facing each stall are various items of horse riding and grooming equipment,
most of the items here do not look like they are of any great value or

This courtyard is a large paved area that is roughly square in shape. 
Two large buildings and a long gray stone wall that runs along the western

slabs and has spread across much of the wall and the buildings.  The tallest
of the buildings is a long gray stone inn on the north side of the courtyard
with a steeply sloping roof covered with brownish orange tiles.  The second
building that lies on the east side of the yard is a stable which is quite
long and low and has mainly been constructed from wood from timber.  Unlike

This is a large enclosed courtyard that is approximately square in shape
and has been paved with small blocks of dull gray stone.  The courtyard has
probably seen better days for stray weeds poke through large gaps and cracks
in the paving, making the area look disheveled.  A grand house with a
steeply sloping roof covered with orange-red tiles overlooks the yard on the
eastern side, an even larger gray stone building lies to the west.  Built
along the northern and southern sides of the courtyard are two long gray
stone walls, a tall archway has been built into the northern wall and
appears to lead into a dark alley.

This courtyard is a large paved area that is roughly square in shape. 
Three large buildings and a long gray stone wall broken only by a tall

slabs and covered much of the visible brickwork.  The tallest of the
buildings is the gray stone inn with a steeply sloping roof covered with
purple tiles on the north side of the courtyard.  The second stone building
on the opposite side of the yard is much shorter and it has been roofed with
dark red tiles.  The building may contain a forge as it is so short and yet
has three large chimney stacks.  The third building on the east side of the
yard is a stable and is a rather long building constructed from timber and
has a curved thatched roof.

This small room within the Three Crowns Inn is a private dining.  The
floor of the room has been covered in a dark green woolen carpet that looks
rather grubby and stained.  The walls of the room may have once been graced
in the past with a layer of whitewash but now the walls have taken up a
dirty shade of gray.  The woodwork within the room is not much better to
look at as the paint has either faded or flaked off with age.  There is a
large window on the northern side of the room that is framed by tattered
curtains.  The window overlooks the River Manetherendrelle outside, a view
almost as gloomy as the one inside this room.

This is just a plain and ordinary corridor that runs through one of the
upper levels of the Three Crowns Inn.  The floor and walls of this area have
been left almost completely bare; nothing has been used to decorate or even
covers the wooden floorboards or walls.  There are a couple of ornate
lanterns that have been hung from the walls; they have been used to
illuminate this dingy corridor although what light they do provide is
minimal.  Apart from several doorways leading into other sections of the
inn, the only other exit seems to be a steep and narrow wooden staircase
that leads downwards into the lower level of the inn.

This is a small yet comfortable guestroom.  The wooden floorboards of the
room look like they are regularly scrubbed clean, their only covering
appears to be a small patterned rug made of wool that has been placed in
front of the doorway leading into the room.  Placed within this guestroom
are a small bed, a chest of drawers, and a writing desk complete with a
matching chair and in the corner of the room a small washstand has been
placed.  The room has a large window on the western side that overlooks the
busy river docks of Remen below.  A small decorative flower box has been
placed upon the outer windowsill containing a beautiful and fragrant
arrangement of wildflowers and herbs.

This is a very long and narrow corridor that runs through one of the
upper levels of the Three Crowns Inn.  The floor and walls of this area have
been left almost completely bare; nothing has been used to decorate or even

illuminate the area by the addition of a couple of ornate lanterns that have
been hung from the walls.  Apart from several doorways leading into other
sections of the inn, the only other exit seems to be a steep and narrow
wooden staircase that leads upwards into the upper level of the inn.  A long
piece of rope has been used to bar the way up the stairs and hung upon the
rope is a small neatly written sign.

This is a large fireplace made of blocks of gray stone.  This is a rather
unusual location to view such an object as this point is within the
fireplace and not outside it.  To the east a busy common room belonging to
an inn can be seen.  Apart from a few patrons gathered around the tables as
well as the serving staff, this is very little of interest to see from here.
A second, more narrow exit can be seen from this point, the chimney flue
that stretches upwards out of sight.

This is a very narrow and cramped chimney flue.  There are black soot
stains upon the walls of the flue that have been constructed from blocks of
gray stone.  Almost hidden within the darkness of this area are small niches
that have been cut into the walls down the flue.  The recesses provide
sturdy footholds up the chimney, but from this point the holes end so there
does not appear to be any way to climb the rest of the way upwards to the
top of the chimney.

Owl Street Bank is a rather peculiar building.  This room is lit up by
smoky lanterns attached to the walls.  Built along most of the east side of
the room is a wooden counter, the only gap is at the south end of the room
to allow access to a large iron-braced doorway.  The only other exit out of
the bank is a second reinforced doorway to the west.  There is an arched
opening set in the wall above the counter complete with wooden shutters. 
Thick iron bars have been built into the hatchway that allows only small
items such as money through.  Parts of the room that sits beyond the barred
hatchway can be seen, it looks rather empty, the only things that sit upon
the shelves there is a small set of scales and a set of tiny weights.

This shop looks like a dingy hovel that has been converted into some sort
of shop.  Dusty shelves line the walls of the shop, filled with items such
as bottles of pigments and inks to rolled-up scrolls and parchments.  At the
center of the room is a large wooden counter; behind the counter lies a
rickety wooden staircase leading to the upper floor of the shop, from which
strange cooing noises can be heard.  A large window built in the western
side of the room is barely translucent from the dust accumulated upon its
panes of glass; a small doorway next to the window provides an exit onto a
street outside.

This room is almost a surreal experience within itself.  It is a tight,
cramped space with a high and steeply sloping ceiling that probably follows
the gradient of the roof of the building.  There are two arched openings
that sit on opposite sides of the room; each one has been fitted with wooden
shutters.  The one on the eastern side of the room is a simple glass paned
window, almost translucent by the amount of dust gathered upon it; the one
on the western side of the room is void of any glass.  There are numerous
large wooden coops that have been built into this attic space, each one
inhabited by rather plump-looking pigeons.  A hatchway in the wooden floor
of this room provides access to a steep wooden staircase that leads to the
lower level of the building.

Like many of the buildings within Remen this bakery has been built from
dull gray stone with additional support from thick wooden timbers.  This
room has been split into two by a tall wooden counter.  The shopkeeper's
wares are on display on racks along the wall behind the counter; products
ranging from loaves of bread to delicious pies and cakes can be seen here. 
A small door almost hidden from view can be seen built into the west wall
although there are no markings visible to give any clues to what lies behind
it.  There is a large window on east side of the room overlooks a long paved
street, at the opposite side of the street more shops and houses can be
seen.  Finally, next to the window there is a scroll carved door that
obviously is an exit leading onto the busy street.

Trash and debris litter the floor of this dingy little hovel.  The gray
stone walls of this building appear grimy especially near the fireplace
where thick sooty stains mar the nearby walls and ceiling.  The floors of
this house look barren with only a few moth-eaten rugs placed upon the floor
as an attempt to cover the bare wood.  A few items, perhaps of sentimental
value to the owner of this house can be seen on display upon wooden shelves.

There are a few pieces of furniture within this abode; they are mostly a
patchwork of reclaimed wood reinforcing woodworm riddled structures.  This
particular house is dimly illuminated by the thin slivers of light that
barely permeate through the dusty windows which give a bleary, distorted
view of similar grimy hovels outside.

This is a very large house that appears to have been abandoned many years
ago.  The entire area is in a state of disarray; the dark wooden paneling
that once adorned the walls of the building has fallen away, revealing the
cold gray stone walls that lay beneath them.  Anything of value appears to
have been looted from this building, apart from a few metal hooks fixed upon
the walls that used to hold lanterns and some broken examples of furniture
which are now debris littering the floor there is very little worth looking
at here.  The only peculiar feature of this house is the main entranceway at
the southern end of the building; the large scroll-carved door has had a
Dragon's Fang etched deep into the woodwork its outer side.

timbers used as support.  The walls of the cellar are cold and glisten with
moisture, a faint sound of water dripping can be heard amongst the shadows
here.  The cellar is almost empty apart from the cobwebs that hang like
drapes from the wooden rafters and the litter and debris strewn across the
floor.  Along the eastern side of the cellar is a steep stone staircase has

looks rather dangerous, the wooden floorboards appear half-rotten and it is
very surprising that they have any strength left within them to support any
weight upon them.  But the boards manage to hold up a mass of broken boxes,
crates, trunks and other debris, although much of the trash left within this
room is buried underneath a blanket of thick cobwebs and dust.  Set in the
floor of the attic is a small wooden trapdoor although the other holes
within the floor are just as good enough to use as exits out of this area.

This is quite a small building for a shop and probably resembles a

of the area is taken up by a large wooden counter set up in the center of

graffiti etched into the surface of the wood but it does not seem the
proprietor of this establishment has bothered to clean it off.  There are
numerous shelves displaying the wares fixed to the cold gray stone wall

bracing.  At this point along the corridor is a spiraling wooden staircase
that leads to the lower part of this building although that section of the
building is not visible from this point as it is hidden within the shadows. 
There is a cold draught flowing through the area that appears to be coming
from the southern end of the chilly passageway.

{rR{De{wm{De{rn M{Di{wlit{Di{ra H{Dead{wquar{Dter{rs{x - {wThe Commander's Office{x~
This is a modestly furnished office that is square in shape with a large
window built into the north wall.  The window has been decorated with a pair
of thick crimson curtains and overlooks an area of steep grassy hills to the
north of the town.  The room is illuminated by ornate oil lanterns worked
from brass and hung from decorative hooks fixed to the walls.  The varnished
dark wooden paneling that has been fitted to the lower half of the gray
stone walls of the room smells faintly of beeswax polish.  On the east side
of the room are two large banners, one is the red and blue flag of Altara
complete with the two golden leopards.  The second banner appears to be the
banner of the Civil Guard of Ebou Dar; perhaps the owner of this office was
once a serving officer?

This is a modestly furnished room that square in shape with a large
window built into the east wall.  The window has been decorated with a pair
of tattered green and overlooks a nearby inn.  Ornate brass oil lanterns
hang from decorative hooks fixed to the walls light up the room itself; each

paneling that has been fitted to the lower half of the gray stone walls of

them.  Hung upon the north and south walls of this room are wooden racks
displaying various items of weaponry and armor although most of the items
appear to be battered, rusty and on the verge of falling to pieces.

This large square room within the Golden Goose Inn serves as a study. 
The study looks relatively plain, very little has been done to decorate its
gray stone walls apart from decorative brass hooks that hold small oil
lanterns used to illuminate the area.  There are two tall windows flanking a
fireplace made of gray stone at the western side of the room.  The floor of
the room has been covered with a thick gray rug that matches the gray
curtains that frame the two windows.  Along the northern wall of this room
are shelves, filled with books as well as small ornaments that look cheap
although they are probably of some sentimental value to their owners.  There
are two exits out of this room, large scroll-carved doors on the southern
and on the eastern side of the study.

The Wayman's Forge is one of the largest inns within the town of Remen. 
Like most of the buildings in the town, this inn has been constructed mostly
from drab gray stone.  This particular section of the inn is a long narrow
hallway that runs east/west and is illuminated by polished brass lanterns
hung upon the wall.  The bare wooden floorboards creak and groan ominously
under the slightest shift of weight placed upon them.  There are numerous
scroll-carved doors seen along the corridor but the main focal points of the
passageway are the two steep wooden staircase built along the northern and
the southern side of the room.  One staircase leads to the upper level of
the inn whilst the other staircase leads to the ground floor.

This is a very large square room with dull gray stone walls that is being
used as a kitchen.  The floor of the kitchen room has been tiled in a
checkered pattern of light and dark square gray stone.  A large stone
fireplace has been built on the northern side of the room and built into the
fireplace is a large spit as a black iron stove.  Numerous sets of cupboards
and drawers have been built underneath stone worktops, whilst fixed to the
walls above them are wooden racks and shelves housing kitchen utensils as
well as miscellaneous jars and bottles.  There appear to be three exits out
of this room, a large wooden door to the south, with two arched windows
built both sides of the door, and two smaller doors to the east and west.

This is the southern end of a long corridor within a building made mainly
of dull gray stone and wooden timbers.  This area would be dark if it were
not for the small oil lanterns that have been hung upon the walls to
illuminate the area, for there are no windows allowing any light from
outside the building inside.  The bare wooden floorboards appear old and
grimy from years of use and lack of cleaning.  There are numerous
scroll-carved doors to seen along the corridor although there are no
indications from this side of the portals to say what lies beyond them apart
from a strange smell of horses that seems to be coming from the
southern-most door.

The Wayman's Forge is one of the largest inns within the town of Remen. 
Like most of the buildings within the town, this inn has been constructed
chiefly from gloomy gray stone.  This particular section of the inn is a
long narrow hallway that runs east/west and is lit up by polished brass
lanterns hung upon the wall.  The bare wooden floorboards creak and groan
ominously under the slightest shift of weight placed upon them.  There are
numerous scroll-carved doors seen along the corridor but the main focal
point of the passageway is the steep wooden staircase built along the
northern side of the room, which leads to the lower levels of the inn.

Rickety wooden planks make up the floor of the attic, despite their frail

small wooden boxes and crates that have been stacked here.  The only exit
out of this area is a small wooden trapdoor set in the floor of the attic.

The blacksmith's workshop is filled with heat that emanates from the
large stone furnace that has been built at the east end of the workshop. 
Several sacks sit in the corner of the room; their contents appear to be
some sort of black rock, probably coal.  In another corner of the workshop
are several large barrels, each one appears to contain clear liquid,
probably water although the barrels are marked with a different symbol. 
Grouped near to the furnace are several large metal anvils, all of different
sizes and each one of them shows heavy signs of use.  There are two exits

the center of the room.  Fixed to the stone wall behind the counter are
several wooden racks that are used to hold various items of fishing
equipment including rods and nets.  There are also several wooden shelves
fixed to the wall that are used to display other merchandise on sale here. 
A strong smell of rotten meat and fish can be smelt from a large wooden
barrel that has been stuffed into the southwest corner of the room; perhaps
it is for the better that the lid remains on the container.

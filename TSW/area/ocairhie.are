sweat, but doesn't look as if he's stopping anytime soon.

This woman is very pretty and obviously taller than the Cairhienin in the
city around her.  She has large, dark eyes, and her hair has been arranged
into a multitude of braids that hang down to her waist.  She seems pleasant
enough, but one cannot help notice that she always seems distracted by
something other than where her focus is at the current moment.

Tammuz~
A wrinkled little man nervously wrings his hands together as he tends shop.
~
The man is on the older side, perhaps as much as sixty or seventy years
old, as his gray hair and wrinkled face gives away.  He seems nervous as he

This man is rather plump, and he wears a {Dgrey{w coat with a single {gg{Gree{gn{w

This man has obviously been in his cups too long, by the stench of him,
let alone how he can barely keep himself upright.  Bits of saliva dribble

Thin and gaunt, his clothes are poorly made and badly in need of mending --
or just plain throwing out.  The shop around him holds many fine things, and
it's doubtful that the man's poor clothing and appearance is from lack of
money.

her long hair hangs down, almost to her waist.  It is somewhat difficult to

early thirties.

a tall, slender man~
A tall, slender man eyes the doorway.
~
This man is rather tall, much taller than the usual Cairhienin.  His hair
is a light brown, and his skin is tanned, marking him as something other
than a Cairhienin to any who would know the difference.  He appears to be
somewhere near thirty years of age.

an old wanderer~
An old man with a long walking stick trudges along here.
~
An old man seems to have reached the end of his days.  He looks tired. 
His eyes are firmly fixed on the path in front of him and where he is going.
He leans heavly on a thick, gnarled walking stick that towers over his bent
and crooked frame.

Alguenya is one of the many {Ddo{wck{Ds{w of the city.  Barges and {rl{yongboat{rs{w are

Off to the south the {YSun{w Palace is visible, rising high into the air as it
sits in the very center of the city, on the highest hill.  Just a bit to the
east is the North Gate, while taking this road to the west ends at the

Sunset Way and North Palace Road~
Sunset Way and North Palace Road meet here to create a large, {Dst{won{De{w
intersection.  The broad roads, wide enough for twelve {rc{Da{rrriag{De{rs{w to travel
down side by side, continue on in all directions.  Just to the west a large
manor house sits next to the road, while the {Ddo{wck{Ds{w on the {Briv{be{Br{w are further
to the west.

North Palace Road~
North Palace Road moves uphill as it goes toward the center of the city
where the {YSun{w Palace sits.  The road here is very broad, wide enough that
large wagons could move down it, ten abreast.  The street and {Db{yu{Dildin{yg{Ds{w are
made of perfectly cut {Dst{won{Des{w, set in the straight lines and angles that are
seen throughout the city of {cC{Ca{Yi{Wrh{Yi{Ce{cn{w.

Palace.  One of the large square towers of the Palace rises into the air
just southeast of here.  The stone {Db{yu{Dildin{yg{Ds{w with {rt{Rile{rd{w roofs that are all
around are nothing compared to the grandeur of the Palace.

From here it is easy to see most of the northwest part of the city of
{cC{Ca{Yi{Wrh{Yi{Ce{cn{w, as the Palace sits on the highest hill in the very center of the
city, the rest of the city moving downhill from here.  Some of the topless
towers can be seen, rising high above the {rt{Rile{rd{w roofs of the other
buildings, and far to the west the {Briv{be{Br{w is barely visible.

The Creator's Blessing~
The tall, stone cube of a {Db{yu{Dildi{yn{Dg{w just to the north is the inn known as
the Great Tree.  The main entrance is here, while the entrance to the
{ystables{w is around the back of the inn.  The Creator's Blessing continues on
to the east and west, and it ends just to the east as it runs into the back
wall of the {YSun{w Palace.

visible.  West Palace Road runs north and south here along the front.  Far
to the north and south the street ends as it runs into the high perimeter
wall that surrounds the city.  To the west The Creator's Blessing moves,

the Coming Dawn continues on to the north and south, while Hill Street moves
to the east and west.  Large {Db{yu{Dildin{yg{Ds{w sit at the four corners of the
intersection, most of which appear to be houses.  A bit to the west the {YSun{w

To the east is a large set of tall {Yb{yronz{Ye{w gates, and beyond that is The Way

Sunset Way and Street of the Royal Library~
Sunset Way and Street of the Royal Library meet here, creating a very
large, {Dst{won{De{w intersection.  A little ways to the south Sunset Way ends as it
meets with the high perimeter wall which makes its way around the city. 
Just over to the west are the {Ddo{wck{Ds{w which run along the {Briv{be{Br{w.  Over to the
southeast is the Royal {yL{Wibrar{yy{w of {cC{Ca{Yi{Wrh{Yi{Ce{cn{w.

Street of the Royal Library~
The massive building just to the south is the Royal {yL{Wibrar{yy{w of {cC{Ca{Yi{Wrh{Yi{Ce{cn{w. 
Made of smooth white {Wst{won{We{w fit together into perfectly square angles, it is
a rather impressive sight.  One of Cairhien's prides, the Royal Library was
the only building in the city that was untouched during the {yA{Di{We{yl{w War.  Broad
steps lead up to the {Yb{yr{Yon{yz{Ye{w doors, which open into the Library.  Street of
the Royal Library continues on to the east and west.

up between them.  The {Db{yu{Dildin{yg{Ds{w that line the street are also made of stone
and resemble large cubes.  Just over to the east is East Palace Road, which

tower is covered with scaffolding, and it shows the damage caused during the
{yAiel{w War.  Like all the Topless Towers throughout the city, parts of this
one {rb{Rurne{rd{w and fell during the war, and it has not yet been repared.  Before
the war these towers were said to be able to touch the {Wc{wloud{Ws{w.

The {ymuddy{w, zigzag street makes its way through the foregate.  Just to the
south is a good-sized {Db{yu{Dildi{yn{Dg{w with its {ydo{Do{yr{w open.  Bright {yl{Yight{ys{w and loud
voices and music pour out of it, and there's a small, faded sign hanging by
the front door.  The sign shows a hand holding a large mug.  The {ymuddy{w road
continues on to the east and west.

perhaps a tavern or inn.

A Muddy Intersection~
The roads that lead off to the north, east, and south come to a rather
large intersection here.  A very tall {gtr{Ge{ge{w grows up directly in the center
of the intersection with the roads leading around it.  A little ways to the
north stands a wooden {Db{yu{Dildi{yn{Dg{w.  Over to the east the {ymuddy{w street leads
back to the northern gates into the city of {cC{Ca{Yi{Wrh{Yi{Ce{cn{w.

of the topless {Dt{wo{Wwe{wr{Ds{w can be seen peeking over the top of the high perimeter

even despite all of the broken {Dw{Cindow{Ds{w.  Mouse droppings are scattered all
over the wooden {yfloor{w.  It is apparent that this building has been abandoned

Outside the Jangai Gates~
The tall, {Dir{wo{Dn-bo{wu{Dnd{w gates which lead into the city are here to the west.
To the east is the foregate, which winds its way around the city of
{cC{Ca{Yi{Wrh{Yi{Ce{cn{w.  The streets outside the city walls are {ymuddy{w and zigzag in all
different directions.  The tall stone walls stretch far to the north and
south around the entire city.

East Foregate~
The {ymuddy{w road which leads through the foregate of {cC{Ca{Yi{Wrh{Yi{Ce{cn{w continues on
to the north and south.  Just to the east is a small, {ywooden{w house with a
{yth{Yatch{yed{w roof.  The {ydo{Do{yr{w hangs precariously from its hinges, and it looks
like even the lightest of {Wwin{wd{Ws{w might blow it off.  All of the {Dw{Cindow{Ds{w are
broken, and little remains of the glass.

East Foregate~
To the north and east the {ymuddy{w road continues.  Over to the east it
appears to turn southward, while it seems to move in a fairly straight line
for a while off to the north.  Just north of here a wooden {Db{yu{Dildi{yn{Dg{w with a
{yth{Yatch{yed{w roof is visible, sitting on the east side of the road.

East Foregate~
The {ymuddy{w road comes to a turn here, leading off to the west and south. 
Unlike the roads inside the city walls of {cC{Ca{Yi{Wrh{Yi{Ce{cn{w, it does not move in a
perfectly straight line.  Instead it wavers back and forth a little as it
moves along.  The road continues on to the south for a while, but over to
the west it appears to make a sharp turn.

East Foregate~
This boring, {ymuddy{w road moves north and south here, coming to a turn just
to the north.  Just to the south is a very large {Db{yu{Dildi{yn{Dg{w.  It appears to
have many rooms and is probably an inn.  Even from here the loud {Wnoise{w
coming from inside is audible.  The road continues on past it to the south
for a while.

Before The Bunch of Grapes~
Just to the west is a large, rickety, wooden {Db{yu{Dildi{yn{Dg{w.  There is a sign
by the front door which reads: "{mThe Bunch of Grapes{w".  {yL{Yigh{yt{w pours through
the {Dw{Cindow{Ds{w along the front wall, and the sounds of the revelry from inside
are loud even here.  Three {Dsteps{w lead down from the front door to intersect
with the {ymuddy{w road, which leads off to the north and south.

Defender of the Dragonwall~
There is a large {rfi{Rr{Ye{Wp{Yl{Ra{rce{w in the northeast corner of the room next to
the door that leads to the private dining room.  To the south the doorway
opens into the kitchen, while there is a hallway and set of stairs to the
west.  The stairs go up to the rooms in the inn, while the hallway leads
around to the {ystables{w.  This common room is very neat, and the tables have
been arranged perfectly.  Mirrored lamps made of {Ws{wi{Dlv{we{Wr{w line the walls next
to the tall, narrow {Dw{Cindow{Ds{w.

In the center of this private dining room is a long {ytable{w surrounded by
chairs.  This room is paneled in dark {Dwood{w that has been carved with
vertical stripes, and shelves along the walls hold pieces of {Ws{wi{Dlv{we{Wr{w.  In the

floor is tiled with dark {bti{Ble{bs{w and is rather clean for a kitchen that sees
so much use.  The door to the south opens into the {ystables{w of the inn, while
the one to the north goes back to the common room.  Over to the east is a
small storage room.

bit of {Ddust{w in the air, but the room is kept pretty clean.  There is a
small, {Ws{wi{Dlv{we{Wr{w lamp by the door which provides the only light to the room,

The Stables~
These {ystables{w are fairly simple with some small stalls along the eastern
and western walls.  The air is slightly musty with smells of {yh{ro{yrs{re{ys{w and {Yhay{w.
There is a door to the north that leads outside to the street, while the
door to the south goes into the kitchen of the inn.

A Private Dining Room~
In the center of this private dining room is a long {ytable{w surrounded by
chairs.  Like the common room just to the east, this room is paneled in dark
{Dwood{w, and shelves along the walls hold pieces of {Ws{wi{Dlv{we{Wr{w.  In the northeast
corner of the room there is a large {rfi{Rr{Ye{Wp{Yl{Ra{rce{w which appears to be kept quite
clean.

the rooms of the inn.  A smooth banister made of dark {Dwood{w rises with the
stairs, and {Ws{wi{Dlv{we{Wr{w lamps with mirrored backs line the walls, providing {yl{Yigh{yt{w
to the area.  Back to the west is the common room.

well as to let some of the {Dpipesmoke{w that floats around the room out.  A
number of {ytables{w and {ychairs{w have been set up around the room, and a few of
the ones in the corners seem to be reserved for people wishing to dice.  A
couple {Db{goard{Ds{w for darts have been set up along the back wall, which is
covered by tiny holes made by darts which didn't quite make their mark.  To
the north is an open doorway leading into the kitchen, while there is a

This boring, {ymuddy{w road continues on through the foregate, which lies
around the city of {cC{Ca{Yi{Wrh{Yi{Ce{cn{w.  One part of the road looks like any other, and
it is easy enough to get lost.  Small wooden {Db{yu{Dildin{yg{Ds{w line the road, some
with signs out front, others which appear to be houses.  {yW{geed{ys{w push up
through the mud only to be trampled down by the {yh{rorse{ys{w and people who
constantly make their way up and down the road.

travel difficult, though, and most people around here choose to travel by
foot.  The road continues on to the east and north, never in a straight line

tall and does not seem to be the sturdiest of structures.  It has a {yth{Yatch{yed{w
roof that is badly in need of repair.

A Modest Home~
The {ydo{Do{yr{w to the north leads out of the house while a small set of stairs
on the southern end of the house lead up.  The house is fairly empty.  There
is a small, blue {br{Bu{bg{w on the wooden floor before the door, and it looks very
worn.  In the kitchen area of the house is a small {ytable{w surrounded by four
chairs.  The walls are lined with small {Dw{Cindow{Ds{w which let in a fair amount
of {yl{Yigh{yt{w.

The {ymuddy{w road which leads through the foregate area of the city of

it turns as it moves past a small, wooden {Db{yu{Dildi{yn{Dg{w.  There is a large rut in
the road here, as if someone's {ywagon{w got stuck, and they had to dig it out.

The {ymuddy{w road comes to a turn here, leading off to the east and south. 
Unlike the roads inside the city walls, it does not move in a perfectly
straight line.  Instead it wavers back and forth a little as it moves along.
Just to the north is a small {Db{yu{Dildi{yn{Dg{w.  There is a {ysign{w by the {ydo{Do{yr{w which
shows a shirt and a dress.  The large front window displays a number of
different types of {bc{Blothin{bg{w.

them.  There is a wide variety of {bc{Blothin{bg{w displayed, all very {Bb{Rr{Yig{Rh{Bt{w and of
the quality that would be seen in the foregate and not inside the city.  At
the northeast corner of the store is a small dressing room.

Before the Manor~
Surrounded by high walls and outlying buildings, this huge manor could
easily be taken for a keep or palace.  Heavy {yb{Yronz{ye{w gates separate it from
the city streets.  Paving stones line the courtyard and lead to the
stableyard.  The manor itself is a massive construct full of tall {Dw{Cindow{Ds{w
with guards patrolling roofwalks and high tower tops from which fly banners
with a {gtr{Ge{ge{w and {Yc{yrow{Yn{w on a field of {Gg{gree{Gn{w.  Broad {Wwh{wi{Wtest{wo{Wne{w stairs lead up
to the wide, {yca{Drv{yed{w front doorway.

Base of the Stairs~
The grand hall ends in a {Wm{ga{Wrb{gl{We{w stairway leading upwards in a square
spiral to the second level.  A large {Gg{gree{Gn{w banner featuring the {gTr{Ge{ge{w and the
{YC{yrow{Yn{w of House Damodred drapes the back wall and is flanked by tall {Dw{Cindow{Ds{w
overlooking the rear courtyard.  Tall, {Yg{yi{Yld{ye{Yd{w lamps stand to both sides of

The smooth, white {Wm{wa{Wrb{wl{We{w floor is polished, and the light from the large,

{Dw{Cindo{Dw{w, but it is too high up on the wall to see out of.  A small niche is
set into the wall to the north holding a large, {yg{Yolde{yn{w statue.  To the east
is a large, angular archway that leads into the dining room.

large, marble {rfi{Rr{Ye{Wp{Yl{Ra{rce{w which covers most of the wall to the south, and a
number of small, {Ws{wi{Dlv{we{Wr{w statues have been arranged on the mantle.  The floor
is of a smooth, white {Wm{wa{Wrb{wl{We{w that has been polished so it shines.  To the

repaired.  A young man smiles good-naturedly to all those who enter.

A Large Bedroom~
This bedroom is rather large, with large {Dw{Cindow{Ds{w set into the wall to the
west, overlooking the courtyard below.  The walls are of a dark, polished
{Dwood{w, and the light from the {yl{Yamp{ys{w reflect off of them.  There is a very
large bed in the middle of the room, resting on top of a soft, dark green
{gca{Grp{get{w.  Blackwood tables are on both sides of the bed, and there is a
small, matching dressing {Dtable{w pushed against the side wall.

A Large Sitting Room~
There is a very large, {Wm{ga{Wrb{gl{We{w fireplace on the wall to the north, and it
nearly stretches from corner to corner.  The mantle above it holds a few
small, {Ws{wi{Dlv{we{Wr{w figurines.  A few large, carved {Dchairs{w are scattered
throughout the room, although they all face the {rfi{Rr{Ye{Wp{Yl{Ra{rce{w.  Near the door to
the west, which leads back out into the corridor, there is a tall {ybo{Wo{ykc{Wa{yse{w. 
The door to the east opens into the bedroom.

overlooking the large courtyard below.  The walls of this room are made of
dark, paneled wood, polished so that the light from the {yl{Yamp{ys{w in the room

The Main Foyer of the Royal Library~
This is the front foyer of the Royal Library of {cC{Ca{Yi{Wrh{Yi{Ce{cn{w.  The floor is
made of very smooth, white {Wsto{wn{We{w, as are the tall walls which reach up to
the high, vaulted ceiling.  To the north large {yb{Yronz{ye{w doors open out to the
streets of the city, while there is a large intersection just to the south. 
Further to the south is a large, {Dm{ba{Drb{bl{De{w staircase leading up to the top
level of the {yL{Wibrar{yy{w.  Any sounds made in here echo faintly, so most
visitors try to proceed quietly.

This intersection is very large, and there are hallways leading off in
all directions.  Just to the north is the main entryway of the {yL{Wibrar{yy{w,
while there is a large, {Dm{ba{Drb{bl{De{w staircase off to the south.  To the east and
west are hallways leading to the stacks of {yb{Wook{ys{w.  Even here there is a
faint, musty smell to the air.  At each corner of this intersection stands a
tall, {yb{Yronz{ye{w lamp.  Their light reflects off of the smooth, white {Wsto{wn{Wes{w of
the floor.

The Kitchen~
A long counter stretches across the northern wall, and there is a large,
open {Dw{Cindo{Dw{w above it.  The wall to the east is mostly occupied by an oven
and a shelf holding various cooking {Dutensils{w.  Just to one side of the room
sits a {ytable{w surrounded by four chairs.  The doorway to the south leads to
the living room of the house.

A Bedroom~
A number of pegs line the wall by the door to the west, which leads back
out into the living room.  A large bed is pushed against the back wall, and
there are two matching {ytables{w sitting to either side of it.  A small dresser
with a mirror on top sits just to the side of one of the {Dw{Cindow{Ds{w along the
walls.

One of the Topless Towers~
The tall, {Dst{won{De{w walls of this tower stretch high up into the air.  There
is scaffolding all around, and it is obvious that work is being done to
repair what was damaged during the {yAiel{w War.  Even damaged and {rb{Rurne{rd{w,
though, this tall tower is quite a sight.  Just to the north is the street
which moves east and west through {cC{Ca{Yi{Wrh{Yi{Ce{cn{w.

The Glassmaker's Store~
The large {Dw{Cindo{Dw{w by the door to the east displays a number of items for
sale here.  Long counters line the walls, displaying {yl{Yamp{ys{w, vases, and
mirrors.  Most of the items are {Yg{yi{Yld{ye{Yd{w and appear to be quite expensive. 
Their lines are also straight and sharp in the {cC{Cai{Yr{Whi{Ye{Cni{cn{w style.

The Tailor's Shop~
Bolts of {bf{Babri{bc{w line the walls in this shop.  They are all of a high
quality but varied in type.  Behind the long counter to the south is a tall
case displaying wheels of {rr{Ribbon{rs{w and t{Dhrea{wd.  Beside the counter stand two
dressing dummies, one a female form and the other a male.  A long, knotted
{Wrope{w hangs from around the neck of the male dummy.

A Large Gathering Hall~
This {Db{yu{Dildi{yn{Dg{w is very large, and mainly just made of this one room.  It
is used for large gatherings, such as meetings and {Wweddings{w.  The doors to
the south, which lead out to the street, are {Yg{yi{Yld{ye{Yd{w, as are the lamps that
line the walls.  Between the lamps are large {Dw{Cindow{Ds{w covered by heavy
{bcurt{Bai{bns{w.  Large vases of {Ws{Ci{cl{Wk{w flowers sit in the four corners of the room,
and there are a number of {ychairs{w lined up in the middle.

A Scent of Spring~
A number of low counters line the walls, displaying a wide variety of
{mf{rl{Rowe{rr{ms{w for sale.  Their light, airy perfume fills the air, and the small,
open {Dw{Cindow{Ds{w that line the walls keep the scents from becoming too
overpowering.  The floor is made of {Dst{won{De{w and kept very clean.  The door to
the south leads back out onto the street.

An Herb Shop~
This shop has a faint, {yearthy{w scent to it.  Dried {gh{yerb{gs{w are tied in
bundles and hanging from hooks along the corners of the room.  The door to
the east leads back out to the street, and the large {Dw{Cindo{Dw{w beside it is
covered with a long, {Wl{wa{Dc{We{w curtain.  A long counter stretches against the
back wall, displaying small vials and pouches as well as a number of mortar
and pestle sets.

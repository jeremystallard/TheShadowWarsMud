{cI have taken the liberty to write this letter of complaint on your behalf

other matters.  {x

{CPlease fire the creator of this area (Illian) because she failed to place
any mobs that do not fight back {x{Cfor level 90+ players to level on.  She has
also added equipment for lower level players which is {x{Cabsolutely disgraceful
because everyone knows that level 90+ players deserve free equipment that is
{x{Cat least as good as quest equipment.  {x {CThe area is far too big for me to map
out and I keep getting lost in it.  There are too many mobs in the {x{Carea and
at the same time there are not enough, one day I will be able to make my
mind up on it.  She {x{Ctook far too long in creating this area; I have built
several 1000 vnum areas in a matter of a {x{Ccouple of weeks although unlike the
creator of this area, all my rooms had the same room description {x{Cwhich saved
time and effort.  {x

is flanked on both sides by large areas of {gg{Grasslan{gd{x although on the east
side of the {cr{Ci{Wv{Ce{cr{x there is an area of {Df{gores{Dt{x too.  To the south lies Illian,
a grand city built from pale green, red and white stone, dotted with grand
towers and palaces.  The city is surrounded by vast areas of{g m{ya{gr{ys{gh{yl{ga{yn{gd{x that

Into Open Waters~
At this point one of Illian's many wide {cc{Ca{Wna{Cl{cs{x opens out into the harbor
area.  The view of Illian from this point is incredible, the city has no
walls and instead it is a mass of towers and palaces.  The buildings are all
pale stone in shades of green, red and white except for some that appears to
be covered with {ww{Whit{we p{Wlaste{wr{x.  The most colorful aspect of the city is the
tiled rooftops that sparkle under the light with a hundred different hues. 
Small fishing {Db{yo{wa{yt{Ds{x work close to the tall {gm{ya{gr{ys{gh g{yr{ga{ys{gs{x that all but
encircles the great harbor while the harbor itself contains huge {Wdo{wck{Ds{x and
shipyards bristling with dozens of {ys{Dh{wi{Dp{ys{x.

{gT{Da{wmm{Du{gz{x {gS{Dq{wua{Dr{ge{x is a great open square that is many hides large and
surrounded by {Ww{wh{Wi{wt{We m{warbl{We c{wo{Wlum{wn{Ws{x with wreaths of {Wo{wl{Di{wv{We br{wa{Dnc{wh{Wes{x at their

has columned walks and airy balconies, slender towers and {Dp{murpl{De r{moof{Ds{x.  The
two palaces almost reflect each other perfectly at first glance but one is a

city by two broad avenues although the southern one is split by an {Da{wr{Wch{we{Dd

{gAn Apothecary's Workshop {x~
This apothecary's workshop is probably one of the tiniest buildings in
Illian.  Strange and wondrous goods lurk upon the {ys{Yh{Welves{x, sealed in their
respective containers.  Each of these {Db{wo{Wttles{x and {Dj{wa{Wrs{x has been carefully
labeled in a strange scrawl that looks alien to this region.  Swinging from
the {yr{Ya{Wfters{x are bunches of {gh{Ge{gr{Gb{gs{x that have been hung out to dry.  A small
stone {yf{Dir{wepl{Dac{ye{x not only provides heat in this drafty establishment but also
a place for the owner to brew or distil their products.  At the back of the
shop is a {yc{Yo{Wunter{x that also serves as a {yw{Yo{Wrkbench{x; there are strange {Dt{wo{Wo{wl{Ds{x
and {Dg{wl{Wassware{x littering the worktop and leaving not much room for anything
else.

are scores of {ybunk beds{x and {ylockers{x arranged neatly along both sides of the
hall.  At the far end of the hall is a doorway leading into the communal
baths.

The door opens to a large, spacious office.  Adorning the walls are
numerous bookshelves with books of warfare, language, and politics.  In the

field of {Gg{gree{Gn{x.  Beyond the rug is a large {rcherrywood{x table, with various
writing tools and rolls of parchment upon it, though most noticable is an
open map of the neighboring countries.  Beside the table are three
comfortable, padded chairs, one behind the table for the Captain-commander
and the other two in front of it for whomever wishes to have a seat.  Two
large windows allow light to stream in, giving this room a homely feeling.

You stand in a semi-large office.  The walls are paneled in {yo{Ya{Wk{x, and
though they darken the room considerably, one large window, which is usually
open, brightens it in contrast.  Small bookshelves are set around the room,
in it some reading material and various books on subjects of warfare.  In

You stand in a medium-sized room.  The floor and walls are paneled with a
light, honey-shaded oak, though the floor looks like it could use some
buffing.  Two small windows adorn the walls, allowing light to come in and
reflect off of the paneling, making the room seem much brighter than it
normally would be.  In the center of the room is a small table, made of what
looks to be pine, and is covered with knick-nacks and a small roll of
parchment and other utensils.  Surrounding the table are two small, padded
chairs, made of a sturdier wood, {yo{Ya{Wk{x.  One small {yb{Yo{Wokshe{Yl{yf{x rests against the
opposite wall of the door, within it various light-hearted reading books
surrounded by books on politics and warfare.  Though small, it has a quaint
air about it, and smells faintly of pine and a faint whiff of {ya{Dl{ye{x.

a layer of sawdust has been used to cover the timber floorboards.  The
exposed beams of the room's high ceiling are roughly hewn and dark with age
like the floorboards beneath them.  A series of {ys{Dl{ya{Dt{yt{De{yd w{Di{yn{Dd{yo{Dw{ys{x along the

room behind which are many {yb{Da{yrre{Dl{ys{x and {yc{Da{ys{Dk{ys{x that have been stacked neatly. 
There are several exits from this room but the most noteworthy ones are the

on the north side of the room that leads outside.

{gThe Palace of Assemblage{x - The Entrance Hall~
It is obvious from the delicate yet flowing designs incorporated in the
green-veined stonework of the Palace of the Assemblage that this structure
was created by Ogier.  This is the entrance hall, a vast chamber supposed by
tall rounded {gp{Gi{Wl{wl{Wa{Gr{gs{x that look as if vines of ivy have twisted around them
but is in fact delicately sculpted into the surface of the {gc{Go{Wl{wu{Wm{Gn{gs{x.  The
floor of the chamber is a colorful mosaic of {gg{Gree{gn{x and {yg{Yol{yd{x, its centerpiece
being the coat of arms of the Assemblage itself.  The walls of the chamber
have been adorned with long wall hangings showing the sigils of the current
merchants and ship owners that make up the Assemblage.  There are several
corridors that lead off from this main chamber; each one is lined with
several foreboding-looking doors made of {Dd{ya{Dr{yk w{Do{yo{Dd{x.

{yT{Yh{We{y K{Yin{Wg's{y P{Yalac{We{x - A Balcony~
This is a balcony that looks over Tammuz Square and a second palace on
the opposite side that looks almost identical to this one.  The balustrade
has been created from the same pale red-veined stone as the rest of the
palace and has been carved in a sinuous, almost organic design.  The only
viable exit from this area is a tall arched doorway leading back into the
King's Palace.

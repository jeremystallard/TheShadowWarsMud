{RSemirhage{x
{w {x
{rInitially known as Nemene Damendar Boann, the woman to be called Semirhage{x
{rwas as well known for healing the body as Graendal was at healing the mind. {x
{rShe was frequently summoned to places all across the world to Heal people{x
{rwho were out of the reach of most every other Aes Sedai in the world.  In{x
{raddition to being a Restorer, though, Nemene was also a sadist.  In return{x
{rfor Healing her patients, she also gave them all a great deal of pain.  Few{x
{rcomplained, as pain was a small price to pay for still being alive.  When{x
{rthe Hall of the Servants discovered what she was doing, they gave her two{x
{rchoices.  One was to be bound with the Power against doing violence, the{x
{rother to be severed from the True Source.  Given those two options, she{x
{rchose a third - swearing to the Dark One at Shayol Ghul.  {x
{w {x
{rSemirhage spent some time serving as both a general and a governor for the{x
{rShadow.  Her reigns over conquered territory were particularly of a{x
{rparticularly violent nature, even for one of the Forsaken.  It was Semirhage{x
{rthat discovered that a circle of thirteen, with thirteen Myrddraal, could{x
{rturn an Aes Sedai to the Shadow against his or her will. {x

{RSammael{x
{w {x
{rTel Janin Aellinsar was a world renowned sportsman, and was a good friend of{x
{rLews Therin Telamon.  He was one of Lews Therin's best generals, and quickly{x
{rfell in love with war.  Most likely it was the honors and special privileges{x
{rwhich came with being a high ranking officer which he enjoyed the most.  Tel{x
{rJanin was always at his best when he was on the defensive, and the forces{x
{ropposing the Shadow were often on the defensive.  {x
{w {x
{rHe considered himself a much better general than the Dragon, and resented{x
{rthe fact that Lews Therin had received the overall command of the forces{x
{ropposing the Shadow over himself.  Suddenly, during the middle of the war,{x
{rhe turned to the Dark One.  Sammael believed that the forces of the Shadow{x
{rwould inevitably win; he also had a very deep hatred of Lews Therin.  {x
{w {x
{rSammael wore a deep scar which was given him by Lews Therin.  While such a{x
{rscar could have easily been Restored (Healed) during the Age of Legends, he{x
{rchose not to.  Sammael was determined to wear it until he had defeated the{x
{rDragon.  As a governor of conquered territories, his administrations were{x
{rterrible.  He paid no attention to the general population, and hunger and{x
{rdisease were commonplace.  His armies, on the other hand, were well fed and{x
{rtaken care of.  He did not want his armies to let him down when it was{x
{rimportant they perform well.  {w {x

{rVery little is known of Rahvin, both before the Collapse or when he became{x

{rUnder the Shadow he held both military commands and political office and{x
{ralthough he was a fair general, his talent was for political and diplomatic{x
{raffairs.  Rahvin's major weakness was his fondness for women and was also{x
{rsusceptible to flattery.  People frequently rose quickly in his{x
{radministration by flattering him although he was quick to remove people who{x
{rwere too unsuited for their duties.  One thing which is known for certain{x
{rabout Rahvin is that he had a tendency to use Compulsion.  {w {x

{RMoghedien{x
{w {x
{rThe Spider was originally known as Lillen Moiral.  Lillen was an advisor for{x

{rethics of the business.  Moghedien turned to the Shadow long before the War{x
{rof Power actually began.  However, she joined Lews Therin's staff and gained{x
{ra position of high standing.  Several disasters early in the war were the{x
{rresult of her work.  Some people, including some of the Forsaken, looked{x
{rdown upon her for lurking in the shadows.  Moghedien resented this.  She ran{x
{ra very efficient intelligence and sabotage network, which was a great aid to{x
{rthe cause of the Shadow.  Her greatest talent was her expertise in{x
{rTel'aran'rhiod.  In the World of Dreams, she was unequaled, even by Lanfear.{x
{rWhile she most certainly could never have equaled Lanfear in the waking{x
{rworld, in Tel'aran'rhiod Moghedien could have bettered the Daughter of the{x
{rNight.  {w {x

{RMesaana{x
{w {x
{rUnlike many of the people who would eventually become known as the Forsaken,{x
{rSaine Tarasind was not among the best in her profession.  Saine harbored{x
{rdreams of becoming a researcher since she had been very young.  But she was{x
{rturned down for a research position at Collam Daan; she ended up teaching{x
{rthere instead.  Rather than making discoveries, she found herself teaching{x
{rabout the discoveries of others.  {x
{w {x
{rUnfulfilled, Saine turned to the Shadow.  Mesaana proved that she was an{x
{radequate general, but was brilliant as a governor of conquered territory. {x
{rHer administrations were efficient, and she started schools which taught{x
{rchildren to spy and report on each other.  These same children were{x
{rencouraged to destroy museums and other sources of ancient knowledge.  It{x
{rwas important to root up and obliterate the old order, in preparation of the{x
{rDark One's triumph.  {w {x

{RLanfear{x
{w {x
{rLanfear's original name was Mierin Eronaile.  Unlike the other Forsaken,{x
{rLanfear chose her own name, which means "Daughter of the Night" in the Old{x
{rTongue.  Mierin was extremely beautiful, possibly the most beautiful woman{x
{rof any Age.  She also became the most powerful female Forsaken, and the{x
{rsecond most powerful over all, topped only by Ishamael.  {x
{w {x
{rMierin worked at Collam Daan, the primary center for research into the One{x
{rPower.  Although Aes Sedai of the time could do things that are undreamt of{x
{rby today's Aes Sedai, Mierin and her colleagues chafed at the limitations{x
{rplaced on their powers by the division between saidin and saidar.  The team{x
{rof researchers Mierin led believed that they had discovered a source of{x
{rpower that could be wielded by either sex.  What they had actually{x
{rdiscovered, though, was a section of the Pattern where the "wall" of the{x
{rDark One's prison had become dangerously thin.  Although she believed that{x
{rthey were helping mankind with their work, Mierin led the group responsible{x
{rfor drilling the Bore, the hole in the Dark One's prison.  All available{x
{revidence suggests that Mierin was unaware of the effect that her actions{x
{rwould have on the future of the world.  {x
{w {x
{rMierin and Lews Therin Telamon had once been in a serious relationship.  It{x
{reventually became clear to Lews Therin that Mierin did not love him so much{x
{ras she loved being associated with him (and his considerable power).  When{x
{rhe left her and married Ilyena Moerelle Dalisar, Mierin became increasingly,{x
{rand dangerously, obsessed with Lews Therin.  Or, more specifically, she{x
{rbecame obsessed with reclaiming the man that she felt had been stolen from{x
{rher.  It is most likely that Mierin's love (and hatred) for Lews Therin{x
{rdrove her to swear to the Shadow.  {x
{w {x
{rLanfear never led any of the Shadow's armies, but she did serve as the{x
{rgovernor of many conquered territories.  The suicide rate was considerable{x
{rin all Shadow-controlled regions, but in Lanfear's territories it was above{x
{raverage.  Her great skill in Tel'aran'rhiod allowed her to further the{x
{rShadow's cause without ever entering a battle.  Her methods ranged from{x
{rinciting entire cities to riot against the established authority to{x
{rtormenting or assassinating an individual using the victim's own dreams{x
{ragainst him.  Suffice to say, those governed by Lanfear did not sleep{x
{reasily.{x

{RIshamael{x
{w {x
{rIshamael means "Betrayer of Hope" in the Old Tongue.  Ishamael was among the{x
{rfirst, if not the first, to pledge his soul to the Dark One.  He was the{x
{rstrongest of the Forsaken and was equaled by none but Lews Therin Telamon{x
{rhimself.  Ishamael was also known as Ba'alzamon, Heart of the Dark, and Soul{x
{rof the Shadow.  Before turning to the Shadow, Ishamael's name was Elan Morin{x
{rTedronai and he was a prominent philosopher of the time.  {x
{w {x
{rAfter turning to the Shadow, Ishamael fought hard to convert Lews Therin to{x
{rthe Shadow.  Some parts of articles that he wrote after turning to the{x
{rShadow indicate his belief that the war between the soul of Lews Therin and{x
{rthe Shadow had gone on since creation.  He viewed this as an endless battle{x
{rbetween the Creator and the Dark One, using human surrogates and that in{x
{rsome previous turnings of the Wheel, Lews Therin's soul had become a{x
{rchampion of the Dark One.  {x
{w {x
{rIt is believed by some that when Lews Therin and the Hundred Companions{x
{rsealed the Bore, Ishamael was not fully trapped.  According to the{x
{rspeculations made by historian Aran son of Malan son of Senar (born circa{x
{r50AB), it may have taken many years for Ishamael to be drawn fully into the{x
{rtrap that had imprisoned the other Forsaken when the Bore was sealed by Lews{x

{RGraendal{x
{w {x
{rGraendal is the most decadent of the Forsaken, wearing enormous gemstones{x
{rand barely transparent gowns.  Before she turned to the Shadow, Kamarile{x
{rMaradim Nindar lived a simple, ascetic life.  She was the Age of Legend's{x
{requivalent of a psychologist, curing mental illnesses too extreme to be{x
{rHealed using the One Power.  Her gift did not stem from strength in the use{x
{rof the One Power; her true power was her keen insight into human motivation{x
{rand behavior.  {x
{w {x
{rThough she was loved by the masses (most of them had only heard of her good{x
{rworks), those who knew her personally tended not to get along well with{x
{rKamarile.  She was highly critical of those who did not live up to her{x
{rstandards; and as those standards were absurdly idealistic, she wound up{x
{rbeing disappointed by most people.  Within ten years after the Bore was{x
{rdrilled Graendal adopted the decadent behavior that is now synonymous with{x
{rher name, becoming the opposite of all that she had been.  There is no{x
{revidence to suggest that this change in behavior was caused by the Dark One.{x
{rBecause the world failed to meet her standards she turned to the Shadow.  If{x
{rthe world would not accept her guidance, she decided that she would lend her{x
{rincredible skills at manipulation to the Shadow.  {x
{w {x
{rAlthough she led no armies for the Shadow, her considerable skill at{x
{rintrigue (and her unparalleled ability to use Compulsion) has aided the{x
{rShadow immensely.  {w {x

{RDemandred{x
{w {x
{rDemandred was originally known as Barid Bel Medar.  Barid Bel Medar could{x
{rhave been the most influential and acclaimed man of his Age, if it were not{x
{rfor Lews Therin.  He was born one day after Lews Therin, almost as powerful{x
{ras the Dragon and almost as skilled.  In the end it was because of his envy{x
{rof Lews Therin that Demandred turned to the Shadow.  {x
{w {x
{rDuring the War of Power, Demandred finally discovered something at which he{x
{rwas at least the equal of Lews Therin - as a military commander in the fight{x
{ragainst the Shadow.  When Lews Therin was named commander of the forces{x
{ropposing the Shadow, Demandred was furious.  He believed himself the{x
{rintellectual superior to the Dragon.  He made the cold calculation that with{x
{rLews Therin commanding the forces opposing the Shadow, the Shadow would win.{x
{rIt was then that Demandred then decided to side with the Dark One. {x

{RBe'lal{x
{w {x
{rBe'lal, the Envious, is certainly the Forsaken of whom the least is known. {x
{rA master of manipulation, his reputation led him to be known as the{x
{rNetweaver.  Originally he was Duram Laddel Cham.  Little is known of{x
{rBe'lal's life before he turned to the Shadow.  Some records indicate that{x
{rhe, like Sammael had been one of the leaders in the fight against the{x
{rShadow.  He went over to the Shadow during the Collapse although it is not{x
{rknown whether or not he joined at the beginning or the end.  {x
{w {x
{rBe'lal was a better manipulator than Rahvin and more skillful than Sammael{x
{rin dealing with enemies in open conflict.  For this reason Be'lal was an{x
{rextremely dangerous adversary.  Be'lal is suspected to be among those who{x
{rrazed the Hall of the Servants days before the Bore was sealed.  {w {x

{RBalthamel{x
{w {x
{rBefore turning to the Shadow, Eval Ramman was a historian, unable to{x
{rdistinguish himself enough to earn the coveted third name.  He specialized{x
{rin the study of vanished cultures, but his work was not outstanding.  Eval{x
{rRamman had a bad temper which almost caused him to be bound with the One{x
{rPower to prevent him from doing something violent.  {x
 
{rHe enjoyed consorting with the lower elements of society, and was very{x
{rpopular with the women.  Perhaps the only reason he did not lose his job was{x
{rhis great strength with the One Power.  The man to be known as Balthamel{x
{rwent to the Shadow for the simple promise of immortality.  {x
 
{rBalthamel might have run an intelligence network which competed with that{x
{rrun by Moghedien.  One of his most prominent atrocities was setting up camps{x
{rto breed humans as food for the Trolloc armies which were ravaging the land.{x

{RAsmodean{x
{w {x
{rBefore turning to the Shadow, Joar Addam Nessosin was an accomplished{x
{rmusician.  A child prodigy, who was accomplished at both composition and{x
{rperformance, he never fully fulfilled his childhood promise.  It was for{x
{rthis reason that Asmodean turned to the Shadow.  With the promise of{x
{rimmortality, he could eventually reach musical heights he was destined for. {x
 
{rAsmodean was never a general for any army, though he did serve as a governor{x
{rof conquered territories.  Perhaps one of his greatest atrocities was the{x
{rrevenge he took against the world's most famous musicians and artists. {x
{rAsmodean had these artists maimed so they would never again be able to{x
{rperform their art before releasing them.  {w {x

{RAginor{x
 
{rThe man called Aginor was the second most powerful of the male Forsaken and{x
{rcame close to rivaling both Lews Therin and Ishamael in strength with the{x
{rOne Power.  He was originally named Ishar Morrad Chuain, and was one of the{x
{rforemost biological scientists of the Age of Legends whose work mainly{x
{rconcerned new variation of plant life, both as crops and as ornamentals.  He{x
{rdid not ascribe to the widely held belief that everything worth discovering{x
{rhad already been discovered.  {x
 
{rHe was one of the first Forsaken to turn to the Great Lord of the Dark. {x
{rAginor apparently turned to the Shadow so he could perform the experiments{x
{rhe wanted to.  Before turning to the Dark One, he was reprimanded several{x
{rtimes for performing unauthorized experiments.  He used his skills as a{x
{rbiological scientist to help the Shadow tremendously.  It was Aginor who{x
{rcreated the Shadowspawn, the first of which were the Trollocs.  Some of his{x
{rcreations are still very well known, such as the Draghkar, whilst some are{x
{ronly known through historical records such as the Gholam and the Jumara.  {x

{RJumara{x
{w {x
{rLike Gholam, little information in the historical records remains about the{x
{rJumara.  A jumara is a worm-like Shadowspawn created by Aginor during the{x
{rWar of Power, jumaras are one of the least known and perhaps one of the most{x
{rdangerous Shadowspawn ever made.  Their presence is familiar in the{x
{rBorderlands, where they are called Worms.  No jumara has been seen outside{x
{rof the Blight in recent times.  Their rarity is a blessing for the people of{x
{rthe world.  A single jumara is said to be able to easily kill a Fade.  Worse{x
{rstill, they travel in packs. {x

{RGholam{x
{w {x
{rLittle information in the historical records remains about the Gholam apart{x
{rfrom that they most dangerous of all of Shadowspawn.  {x
{w {x
{rThe gholam were created by the Forsaken for one reason- to kill Aes Sedai. {x
{rOnly created six, because even the Forsaken feared the danger the gholam{x
{rpresented.  Three of these gholam were created in the forms of women, three{x
{rin the forms of men.  {x
{w {x
{rThe gholam are dangerous because they are immune to the One Power.  Weaves{x
{rof the Power directed toward a gholam simply flow around them.  The danger{x
{rthey present to Aes Sedai is obvious.  Stripped of their most potent{x
{rdefense, an Aes Sedai would be vulnerable to a physical attack.  {x
{w {x
{rBut the gholam are dangerous in other ways.  They are fast, strong, and{x
{rcunning.  They are also flexible, able to slip under a doorway.  It would be{x
{rnearly impossible to defeat them in single combat, as normal weapons do not{x
{rseem to hurt them in any manner.  {x
{w {x
{rIt was generally thought that they were all destroyed or lost during the War{x
{rof Power or the Breaking of the World.  {w {x
~
E
page_05~
{RDarkhounds{x
{w {x
{rNot all of the Shadowspawn were designed to with human features.  Darkhounds{x
{rwere created using canine stock, possibly wolves, corrupted by the Shadow. {x
{rThe Darkhounds' only resemblance to a normal hound is the general shape. {x
{rDarkhounds are darker than the night and as large as a pony.  They were{x
{rinitially created as guard beasts during the War of Power.  Later, they were{x
{rlater used to hunt down the Dark One's enemies.  {x
{w {x
{rIt is possible that much like the Myrddraal, the Darkhounds were slightly{x
{rshifted out of reality in their creation.  They leave no mark on even the{x
{rsoftest ground, yet leave footprints in the hardest stone.  Often the smell{x
{rof burning sulphur accompanies them.  Both the blood and saliva of a{x
{rDarkhound is highly toxic, toxic enough to cause a slow and agonizing death{x
{rwith one drop on the skin.  {x
{w {x
{rDarkhounds do not easily give up on a trail once on it.  The Darkhounds{x
{rdislike rain and thunderstorms, but this will not stop them once on the{x
{rtrail of their quarry.  They are faster than horses, and can maintain their{x
{rspeed longer than even the strongest horse.  Once a Darkhound is on the{x
{rtrail, the only choice is to turn and kill it, or be killed.  {x
{w {x
{rThe only way to escape a Darkhound is to cross over running water -{x
{rDarkhounds do not like rain or thunderstorms and will not usually venture{x
{rinto them.  They also refuse to cross flowing water of any kind.  Darkhounds{x
{rare among the most tenacious servants of the Shadow, simply not giving up{x
{rwhile they still breathe.  {w {x

{RGray Men{x
{w {x
{rUnlike other Shadowspawn, Gray Men are not constructs.  Instead, they are{x
{rmen and women who did not mere pledge their souls to the Shadow as{x
{rDarkfriends did, they actually given their souls to the Dark One also{x
{rearning them the name of "Soulless".  {x
{w {x
{rThey are effective assassins as somehow this lack of a soul makes them seem{x
{rvery ordinary and difficult to notice in a crowd.  Oftentimes the victim{x
{rnever sees them coming.  There have even been instances where a Gray Man{x
{rkilling someone in a crowd was never even noticed.  Even the most vigilant{x
{rof defenders can fail to notice a Gray Man, which would explain why they are{x
{rfrequently used to attack important targets.  The Gray Men could be{x
{rconsidered the most dangerous of the Dark One's assassins.  {x
{w {x
{rIt is unknown what causes these men and women to give their souls to the{x
{rGreat Lord of the Dark, as opposed to merely pledging to the Shadow as{x
{rtypical Darkfriends do.  However, the number of Gray Men suggests that the{x
{rrewards for this sacrifice must be great indeed.  {w {x
~
E
page_03~
{RDraghkar{x
{w {x
{rLike Trollocs, the Draghkar were deliberate creations incorporating the{x
{rcorruption of human stock.  A Draghkar looks a great deal like an overly{x
{rtall man but their eyes are too large, and their skin too pale.  The{x
{rDraghkar appear to be wrapped in a black cloak, but this cloak is actually a{x
{rpair of bat-like wings.  {x
{w {x
{rUnlike the Myrddraal and Trollocs, the Draghkar have little in the way of{x
{rfighting ability due to their frail nature.  Instead, the Draghkar use their{x
{rsoft, hypnotic song to draw their prey to them.  Once the Draghkar have{x
{rtheir prey, they "kiss" them, slowly draining away the person's soul.  After{x
{rthe soul has been devoured, the Draghkar then drains away life as well.  {x
{w {x
{rPeople rescued from the clutches of a Draghkar are lifeless shells, with no{x
{rsoul or personality left to them.  Once a Draghkar has a hold of someone, it{x
{ris probably best to let the Draghkar finish its work.  {x
{w {x
{rUsing their wings, the Draghkar are capable of flight so are used primarily{x
{ras outdoor assassins when their targets are alone.  They are less effective{x
{ras indoor or daylight assassins as they have a great difficulty gaining{x
{raccess into sealed areas or dealing with groups of people or sunlight.{x
~
E
page_02~
{RMyrddraal{x
{w {x
{rMyrddraals were not at first intentionally created, instead they were the{x
{rtwisted offspring of Trollocs in which the human stock used in the creation{x
{rof the Trollocs has resurfaced but tainted by the evil used to create the{x
{rTrollocs.  They have tall, muscular bodies, and move with a serpent's speed{x
{rand grace.  Their skin is a pale white, and a Myrddraal could almost be{x
{rmistaken for a man except for the lack of eyes.  However, this lack does not{x
{rhinder them - they see like eagles in even the deepest night.  {x
{w {x
{rThe Myrddraal are able to disappear wherever shadows exist, and move to{x
{ranother shadow far away.  None understand how this is done.  Aginor believed{x
{rthat the Fades might be slightly shifted out of phase with reality.  Halfmen{x
{rappear as misty blurs in a mirror, and their dead black cloaks are not{x
{rtouched by even the strongest wind.  Their only known weakness is running{x
{rwater, which will cause an end to any casual pursuit.  {x
{w {x
{rThe eyeless gaze of a Fade inspires paralyzing fear in even the bravest of{x
{rwarriors.  It is this ability to cause fear which makes them excellent{x
{rcommanders of Trollocs.  In addition, the Myrddraal have the ability to link{x
{rwith a number of Trollocs, taking control of their minds and wills. {x
{rHowever, the death of this Myrddraal means the simultaneous deaths of all{x
{rthe Trollocs it is linked to.  {x
{w {x
{rThe Myrddraal do not use the same crude weapons and armor as their Trolloc{x
{rparents.  Instead, they wear black plate armor, which enhances their{x
{rserpent-like appearance.  The Halfmen wield swords made at Thakan'dar, near{x
{rthe entrance to the Pit of Doom.  Each sword is quenched in the tainted{x
{rstreams of Shayol Ghul and seasoned with a human soul.  A wound inflicted by{x
{rone of these blades always proves fatal unless the One Power is used to Heal{x
{rthe victim.  {x
{w {x
{rThe Myrddraal are known by many names, among them Shadowmen, Halfmen, Lurk,{x
{rthe Eyeless, Fades, and Neverborn.{x
~

page_01~
{RTrollocs{x
{w {x
{rTrollocs were initially created before the War of the Shadow when the Dark{x
{rOne was in need of soldiers.  Scientists loyal to the Shadow, chief among{x
{rthem Aginor blended the genetic material of humans and naturally aggressive{x
{ranimals such as bears, boars, wolves, goats, wildcats, rams and eagles.  The{x
{rresulting man-beasts, each with a face and characteristics of the particular{x
{ranimal it was crafted from were called Trollocs.  {x
{w {x
{rTrollocs are large and power creatures approximately eight to ten feet in{x
{rheight with the body of an overlarge, extremely muscular man.  They are{x
{rstronger than either the human or the animal of their heritage.  They are{x
{romnivorous and will eat any kind of meat, including human flesh and the{x
{rflesh of other Trollocs.  Initially, however, the Trollocs were a failure in{x
{rterms of a potential soldier.  A lack of discipline and ability to take{x
{rorders, as well as a lazy and deceitful nature, prevented them from becoming{x
{rthe effective warriors the Dreadlords had hoped to create.  {x
{w {x
{rTrollocs organized themselves into tribes, and are the only creations from{x
{rthe War of Power to have an organized social structure.  The chief tribes{x
{rare Ahf'frait, Al'ghol, Bhan'seen, Dha'vol, Dhai'mon, Dhjin'nen, Ghar'ghael,{x
{rGhob'hlin, Gho'hlem, Ghraem'lan, Ko'bol and the Kno'mon.  {x
{w {x
{rOnly the males fight, with the females doing little but serving as breeding{x
{rmachines.  The Trollocs do not always breed true.  Sometimes throwbacks to{x
{rthe animal side are born, which die quickly.  Throwbacks to the human side,{x
{rcalled Myrddraal, usually survive. {x

{wIt is a tremendous struggle for the people of Fal Dara to live so close{x
{wto the Blight.  The constant fighting greatly affects the way the Shienaran{x
{wwarriors view life.  The three most important values to the Shienaran{x
{wwarriors are peace, beauty, and life.  Peace, because they have never known{x
{wit.  Beauty, because they are so near the corruption of the Blight.  Life,{x
{wbecause they are sworn to death.  {x
 
{wTo the Shienaran warriors, it is the quality of life that matters, not any{x
{wmaterial wealth that is gained.  The soldiers are buried unclothed.  It is{x
{wtheir belief that all came from the earth, and they wish to return as they{x
{wcame to the last embrace of the mother.  {x
 
{wThe Shienarans are the finest heavy cavalry in the world.  Like Fal Dara,{x

{wbuilt on hills, to gain a commanding view of the countryside.  They are{x
{wsurrounded by stone walls and heavy iron gates.  Nothing taller than short{x
{wgrass is allowed to remain for at least a half-mile beyond the town walls. {x

{wthe Blightborder, such as Fal Dara, which more closely embody the fighting{x
{wspirit of Shienar.  Everything except the surrounding farms are enclosed{x
{wwithin the city walls.  Fal Dara, and the cities like it, were built for{x
{wstrength and beauty.  {x
 
{wLike all cities along the Blightborder, no man may be permitted to wear a{x

{wThe largest of the Border nations, Saldaea is larger than Shienar and Arafel{x

{wWhile as ferocious in battle as any of the Border nations, their equestrian{x
{wskills are undoubtedly superior.  The Saldaeans are the greatest light{x
{wcavalry in the world.  {x
 
{wFor Saldaeans, war is a family affair.  The wives of officers and nobles{x
{waccompany their husbands on all campaigns except those into the Blight. {x
{wWhile not trained with the sword, Saldaean girls are quite skilled both with{x
{wknives and in hand-to-hand combat.  All Saldaeans are armed with at least a{x
{wknife at all times; in Saldaea, steel is not bared unless it will be used. {x
 
{wThe Saldaean economy is strong.  Built upon the trade of furs, wood, and ice{x

{wAnother important part of Saldaean life is the sa'sara, a dance outlawed by{x

{CCapital city: {cMalkier.  {x
 
{wMalkier was one of the twenty-four nations formed either during or shortly{x
{wafter the War of the Hundred Years.  It was one of five Borderlands until it{x
{wfell to the Blight in the 950's NE.  It was located north of Shienar and{x
{wArafel.  Malkier was known both for the seven towers, and for it's necklace{x
{wof a thousand lakes.  The towers still stand today, broken and jagged, and{x
{ware circled by the lakes.  Other locations in Malkier include Herot's{x
{wCrossing and the Stair of Jehaan.  {x
 
{wThe nation of Malkier was a monarchy, ruled by a King and Queen.  At any{x
{wgiven time, there are supposedly five Great Lords of Malkier.  In order to{x
{wname a new King, they must "cast the rods" and decide who is fit to be king.{x
{wIn Malkier, unlike in some of the southlands, when a King is married, his{x
{wwife is crowned as Queen when they exchange rings.  Among the Malkieri, the{x
{wKings are denoted by the "al" before their first name, and the Queens by the{x
{w"el" before their first name.  {x
 
{wWomen in Malkier wear the ki'sain, a colored dot, on their forehead.  It{x
{wsymbolizes their willingness to pledge their sons to oppose the Shadow. {x
{wUnmarried women wear a blue ki'sain, married women wear a red ki'sain, and{x
{wwidows wear a white ki'sain.   Men wear a hadori, a thin, braided leather{x
{wcord, around their foreheads to hold their hair back.   One of the other{x
{wcustoms of Malkier is that of a carneira.  The word "carneira" translates to{x
{w"first", and regards a person's first lover.  While young women chose their{x
{wown carneira, young men do not have a choice; their carneira chooses them. {x
{wWhen a young man is chosen by his carneira, she will have him make a daori,{x
{wa long cord woven of his hair.  When the man is holding the daori, his{x
{wcarneira has the advantage over him; the daori must be taken from the person{x
{wby the carneira in order for this advantage to be laid aside.  The daori is{x
{wpresented by the carneira to the man's bride on his wedding day.  There is a{x
{wsaying that "a king is not a king, alone with his carneira".   Most of the{x
{wMalkieri that remain alive have assimilated themselves into other nations{x
{wand cultures, trying to forget the memories of Malkier.  {x
 
{wThere is little specific information on Malkier's army, but it can be{x
{wassumed, of course, that their army was very strong indeed.  Befoer the{x
{wdestruction of Malkier Shienar was not considered to be a Borderland because{x
{wof Malkier.  While the men of Shienar rode forth to help protect the{x
{wBlightborder, it was Malkier who held back the Blight.   {x

{wKandor is Chachin, located in the mountains of Kandor.  The merchants of{x
{wChachin have a good reputation and considerable wealth, even though the{x
{wcity's nearness to the Blight prevents it from being a major trading city. {x
{wAnother well known city in Kandor is Canluum, with the town of Ravinda{x

{wThey are worn by both men and women, and can sometimes be quite{x
{wostentatious.  Kandori men wear their beards in a distinctive forked style,{x
{wand often wear up to three silver chains over their coats.  Loose breeches{x
{wseem to be worn by both men and women alike.  {x
 
{wThere is not much specific information on the military of Kandor, but it is{x
{wknown that the martial arts are just as highly developed in Kandor as in the{x

{wArafel is one of the Borderland nations that is devoted to protecting the{x

{wwith the Blight to the north.  The eastern border between Arafel and Shienar{x
{wis formed by the Mora River and the southern border by the Erinin.  The{x
{wterrain of Arafel is much more rugged than that of its neighbor, Shienar,{x
{wand is at least partly made up of grasslands.  Like all of the Borderlands,{x
{wArafel became a nation near the beginning of the War of the Hundred Years.  {x
{wThe governors of the five northern provinces met; the outcome of this{x

{wtherefore protecting the peace of the land.  {x
 
{wNative Arafellins are characterized by their large eyes and pale skin.  The{x

{CBanner: {cThree white crescent moons across a half red, half gold field.{x
{COther symbols:{w {cThe Crescent Moons and the Stone of Tear.{x
{CCapital city: {cTear.{x
{COther towns: {cGodan.{x
 
{wTear is one of the richest nations in the land.  This comes in part from{x
{wcontrolling the greatest port on the Sea of Storms.  A great deal of Tear's{x
{wwealth comes from the oil produced on the country's numerous olive farms. {x
{wLucrative trade in grain and fish also brings money into rich nation of{x
{wTear.   However, it is only the nobles of Tear who have grown rich off the{x
{wnation's vast wealth.  This is because of the view unique to Tairen lords{x
{wthat commoners are actually lesser beings.  The distinction between Tairen{x
{wlords and commoners is a sharp one, to the point where they even dress{x
{wdifferently.  Until very recently, it was not even possible for a commoner{x
{wto call a noble before a magistrate.  {x
{w {x
{wUnlike most nations, Tear is not ruled by a king or queen.  Instead, Tear is{x
{wruled by the High Lords.  The number of High Lords has varied over time from{x
{wsix to twenty, but they are always of a particular rank.  {x
{w {x
{wThe city of Tear goes further in enforcing the differences between commoners{x
{wand nobles.  The inner city is surrounded by a high wall of gray stone. {x
{wWithin the wall are the finer houses and palaces of the nobles, which line{x
{wstreets paved with stone.  Outside the wall, commoners trudge through{x
{wunpaved, muddy streets.  {x
{w {x
{wThe city of Tear is dominated by the Stone of Tear, which towers above the{x
{wcity like a small mountain.  It is believed to be the oldest stronghold of{x
{wmankind, erected shortly after the Breaking of the World.  It was built with{x
{wthe One Power, Earth, Air, and Fire fusing stones together without joint or{x
{wmortar.   Deep within the Stone is the Heart of the Stone.  This is where{x
{wthe great sword Callandor is held, protected by the One Power.  Callandor is{x
{wactually one of the greatest sa'angreal ever, waiting for the Dragon Reborn{x
{wto claim it.  No one except the High Lords are allowed to enter the Heart,{x
{wand even they rarely enter it.  The High Lords only enter the Heart four{x
{wtimes a year for the Rite of Guarding, and to raise a lord to a High Lord. {x
{wIndeed, if the High Lords could manage to forget that the Heart of the Stone{x
{wand Callandor existed, they undoubtedly would.   This is due partly to the{x
{wfact that it is prophesied that the Stone will not fall until the Dragon has{x
{wbeen Reborn.  The High Lords like to think that by protecting Callandor,{x
{wthey are protecting the world from the Dragon Reborn.{x

{wAlso, Tairens fear anything to do with the One Power.  Aes Sedai are{x
{wforbidden to channel while in Tear.  The Stone also houses a collection of{x
{wangreal and ter'angreal second only to the White Tower.  It is unsure{x
{wexactly why the Tairens have collected such an array; perhaps to prevent{x
{wtheir use by Aes Sedai, or maybe to ease the knowledge that they possess the{x
{wgreatest of them, Callandor.{x

{WIllian{x
{CBanner: {cNine golden bees on a field of green.{x
{COther symbols: {cThe Laurel Crown and the Golden Bees.{x
{CCapital city: {cIllian.{x
 
{wIllian is a strong nation on the Sea of Storms.  It has grown rich on the{x
{wtrade that flows into the nation by river and sea.  Illian has a very solid{x
{wrelationship with neighboring Altara.  It was Illian that protected Altara{x
{wduring the Whitecloak War, seeking to maintain Altara as a buffer between{x
{witself and Amadicia.  {x
 
{wIllian is not governed solely by the King.  Illian also has an advisory{x
{wCouncil of Nine, made up of nine nobles.  Additionally, the Assemblage, also{x
{wan advisory entity, is made up of the richest merchants and traders in the{x
{wkingdom.  {x
 
{wThe King and the Council of Nine have struggled for power since the nation{x
{wof Illian was established.  The first King told the first Council that they{x
{wcould have any palace, so long as it was not larger than his own.  So the{x
{wCouncil proceeded to erect a palace identical to the King's, but smaller in{x
{wevery dimension by one foot.  These two palaces, standing on opposite sides{x
{wof the great Square of Tammaz, exemplify the power struggle that is the{x
{wIllianer government.  {x
 
{wOf course, the Assemblage also seeks to add to its own power.  This power{x
{wstruggle makes the Illianer government slow and ineffective, leaving most{x
{wIllianers to live as they wish.  {x
 
{wOne legendary item of history has special ties with Illian - the Horn of{x
{wValere.  The first Hunt of the Horn in Illian was called between the Trolloc{x
{wWars and the War of the Hundred Years.  Another Hunt was recently called in{x
{wIllian, and heroes came to seek the Horn or at least a place in history.  {x
 
{wThough Illian's military might is formidable, its finest soldiers are those{x
{wwithin the elite unit called the Illianer Companions.  These crack troops{x
{wtraditionally ride with the commanding general during any military action,{x
{wto be deployed wherever their extraordinary abilities are needed, usually in{x
{wthe hottest fighting.  During the Whitecloak War, the Children of the Light {x
{wset a trap at Soremaine that caught King Stepeneos and would have destroyed{x
{whis entire army if it were not for the valour of the Companions.  They held{x
{wthe field long enough to allow the rest of the army to escape to safety, and{x
{wthus prevented Altara, as well as Murandy and Illian, from falling under the{x
{wsway of the Whitecloaks.{x

{wThe people of Tarabon like to refer to themselves as the Tree of Man, and{x
{wclaim to be the descendants of the nobles and rulers of the Age of Legends. {x
{wEarly in its history, it is believed that Tarabon possessed either a branch{x
{wor a living sapling of Avendesora, the Tree of Life.  {x
 
{wTarabon has squabbled with Arad Doman throughout its history for the{x
{wpossession of Almoth Plain.  Only recently, though, has this conflict{x
{wevolved into actual war.  Tarabon was once a powerful nation, with a strong{x
{weconomy and great political influence.  Recently Tarabon has fallen on hard{x
{wtimes, with a faltering economy and diminishing power in the world.  {x
 
{wTarabon is ruled in a very unique way, jointly by a king and a panarch.  The{x
{welection of these two rulers is the only real function of Tarabon's Assembly{x
{wof Lords.  The King is responsible for spending revenue, controls the army,{x
{wand oversees the High Court.  The Panarch collects revenues, commands the{x
{wCivil Watch, and is in charge of the lower courts.  {x
 
{wTanchico is the capital city of Tarabon, and is one of the oldest surviving{x
{wcities on the continent.  Some historians claim that parts of the Panarch's{x
{wpalace was built during the Age of Legends.  Tanchico itself is larger than{x
{wcities such as Tear and Caemlyn, and is a great center of trade and{x

{wArad Doman plays a rather minor role in the politics of the land.  It is has{x

{wtrying to gain control of this piece of land.  {x
 
{wDomani women are the source of the nation's fame, as only the Sea Folk women{x
{ware more graceful.  Domani women wear clothes considered scandalous in most{x
{wcountries, and have raised the practice of seduction to an art.  Mothers{x
{wbegin teaching their daughters this art at an early age.  {x
 
{wIf Arad Doman owes its fame to its women, it similarly owes its national{x
{wwealth to them.  Most Domani merchants are women, and few men come out on{x
{wtop after a bargaining session with a Domani woman.  Most men, however,{x
{wconsider losing to be worth the experience.  {x
 
{wThe capital of Arad Doman is Bandar Eban, which also serves as a center of{x
{wtrade.  The Domani trade a great deal with the Sea Folk, and are among the{x
{wfew merchants in the land who can hold their own against in bargaining with{x

{CCapital city:{c Ebou Dar.{x
{COther towns: {cRemen.{x
 
{wAltara lies between the more powerful nations of Illian and Amadicia. {x
{wAltara itself is barely a unified nation, with most Altarans preferring to{x
{wrefer to themselves as subjects of one noble or another.  The only reason{x
{wAltara was not taken over during the Whitecloak War was the aid of Illian;{x
{wIllian intervened only to maintain Altara as a buffer between Amadicia and{x
{witself.  {x
 
{wThe Altarans are a fierce, but polite, people.  This is most evident in the{x
{wprevalence of dueling in Altaran culture.  Most men and women have{x
{wparticipated in at least one duel by the time they reach adulthood, priding{x
{wthemselves on their courage.  As in many other countries, men duel over the{x
{wrights to a woman, with the woman going to the victor.  Unique to Altara,{x
{wthough, is women dueling over men.  The death of a man at the hands of a{x
{wwoman is justified unless proven otherwise, which results in men treating{x
{wthese dangerous Altaran women with the utmost respect.  {x
 
{wNowhere is the Altaran nature more evident than the capital city of Ebou{x
{wDar.  Ebou Dar is divided into two sections by the River Eldar.  The west{x
{wside is filled palaces and large buildings.  All of these buildings are{x
{wpale, made of white rock or lightly colored marble.  The west side of the{x
{wcity is surrounded by a large, thick wall.  {x
 
{wThe east side of Ebou Dar is known as the Rahad.  The Rahad, poorer than the{x
{wwestern portion of the city, is filled with lightly colored buildings,{x
{wpainted white to resemble the richer buildings on the opposite side of the{x
{wriver.  The streets are more likely to be alleys, and are filled with a much{x
{wrougher population than the west side of the city.  Duels are an hourly{x
{woccurrence, and those foolish enough to wear fine clothes into the Rahad are{x
{woften killed for them.  {x
 
{wAltara is a nation weakened by a lack of unity, and is available for the{x
{wtaking by a nation powerful enough to seize it.{x

{wThe people of Murandy, much like the people of Altara, do not really{x

{wclaim allegiance to one or another of the local lords.  {x
{w {x
{wThe ruler of Murandy seldom controls events outside of the capital city of{x
{wLugard.  Even within Lugard, the monarch is sometimes helpless to affect the{x
{wcourse of events.  The only reason a monarch is tolerated in Murandy is as a{x
{wdeterrent to incursions by foreign nations.  {x
{w {x
{wThe capital city of Lugard is located in central Murandy, and it is the{x
{wtrade flowing through Lugard which keeps Murandy alive.  Despite whatever{x
{wpolitical conflict might be disrupting daily life in Murandy, trade{x
{wcontinues to flow through Lugard.  It is one of few cities which has more{x
{winns and stables than residences and shops.  {x
{w {x
{wLugard was once surrounded by a tall stone wall, but it has since crumbled. {x
{wIn many places around the city, piles of rubble mark where the wall once{x
{wstood.  The many thieves who call Lugard home consider any foreigner a fair{x
{wmark, and the unpaved roads and alleys are frequently dangerous to travel{x
{walone.  {x
{w {x
{wMurandy plays a minor role in world politics.  The lack of an effective{x
{wruler makes it difficult for Murandy to defend itself, much less to make its{x
{wpresence felt in the rest of the land.{x

{wAccording to the maps, Ghealdan is entirely made up of land formerly claimed{x

{wCairhien, like many of the current nations, became sovereign at the end{x

{wless than half the land it once controlled.  {x
 
{wThe Cairhienin had a period of four hundred years in which they enjoyed a{x
{wperiod of unprecedented wealth.  This was brought about by the Aiel's{x
{wgranting of the right to cross the Aiel Waste and trade for silk in Shara. {x
{wThis prosperity ended when Laman Damodred cut down Avendoraldera and{x
{wunknowingly sparked the Aiel War.  It was during this war that the city of{x
{wCairhien was burned to the ground.  {x
 
{wThe politics of Cairhien are dominated by the Great Game, the Game of{x
{wHouses.  The nobles took the plotting and intricacies of life within the{x
{wWhite Tower, and gave it their own twist.  Also called Daes Dae'mar, it is{x
{wresponsible for almost every major disaster in Cairhien's history.  To the{x
{wCairhienin, everyone has a hidden motive, every word has another meaning. {x
{wEverything is believed to be a move to gain more power and strength.  {x
 
{wThe Cairhienin are a very reserved people.  They also prefer complete{x
{wcontrol over their environment.  This can be seen in the layout of the city{x
{wof Cairhien, which is a precise grid pattern, all streets meeting at right{x
{wangles.  {x
 
{wThe only time the Cairhienin reserve breaks is during the Feast of Lights. {x

{COther towns: {cBaerlon, Whitebridge, Aringill and Fourkings.{x
 
{wAndor is the largest nation in the land, and is one of the oldest as{x
{wwell.  It was founded during the War of the Hundred Years.  Many of Andor's{x
{wtraditions were established during these early years.  Unlike many nobles of{x
{wthe time, Queen Ishara, Andor's first ruler, knew that no one ruler would be{x
{wable to take control of Hawkwing's entire empire.  Instead, she focused on{x
{wcontrolling only what she could.  As a result, Andor began only with the{x
{wcapital city of Caemlyn and the small surrounding villages.  Cautious{x
{wexpansion marked the reigns of the early queens of Andor.  {x
{w {x
{wThe oldest tradition of Andor is that only a queen must sit on the Lion{x
{wThrone of Andor, and wear the Rose Crown.  The eldest daughter is known as{x
{wthe Daughter-Heir, and is always sent to Tar Valon to study.  The eldest{x
{wbrother of the Daughter-Heir is sworn to protect her with his life, and is{x
{wprepared from an early age to take control of Andor's army.  {x
 
{wCaemlyn is the capital city, second in beauty only to Tar Valon.  The city{x
{wof Caemlyn is actually made up of two cities, the New City and the Inner{x
{wCity.  The New City is less than two thousand years old, constructed{x
{wexclusively by humans.  The ancient Inner City, on the other hand, was{x
{wconstructed by Ogier.  The entire city is encircled by a fifty-foot wall;{x
{wthe Inner City itself is also surrounded by a wall.  Certainly the most{x
{wimpressive building in the Inner City is the Royal Palace, which serves as{x
{wthe seat of government for Andor.{x
{w {x
{wAndor is a strong nation, backed by a strong army consisting primarily of{x
{wthe Queen's Guards.  Andor has always been under almost constant pressure{x
{wfrom neighboring countries.  Andor and Cairhien have to been to war more{x
{wtimes than any two countries except for Tear and Illian.  Similarly, the{x
{wChildren of the Light have always had a reason to dislike Andor, as the{x
{wqueen always studies in the White Tower.  {x
 
{wAndor's strength comes from its wealth.  Much of this is generated in the{x
{wMountains of Mist, far to the west of central Andor.  Gold, silver, iron,{x
{wand copper are extracted from the rich mines in these mountains.  Most of{x
{wthis metal is refined in the smelters near the mines.  {x
 
{wMost of the iron, however, is sent to the Baerlon Ironworks, famous{x
{wthroughout the land for the quality of its work.  The last several Queens{x
{whave had trouble controlling this region, however.  Luckily for these{x
{wQueens, the metal coming out of Baerlon must travel through the rest of{x
{wAndor to reach the rest of the land.  This might be the only thing that{x
{wallows the crown to retain control of an area so important to its economy. {x
 
{wThe strength which must be expended to retain the valuable mines in the{x
{wMountains of Mist means that other outlying regions of Andor have been{x
{wvirtually forgotten.  A good example of this is the Two Rivers, where few{x
{weven realize they are part of a larger kingdom.  One well-known town in the{x
{wfar west of Andor is Whitebridge, so named for the large bridge which{x
{wcrosses the River Arinelle into the town.{x

{wAmadicia itself is a relatively minor player in world politics.  It is{x
{wbetter known as the home of the Children of the Light.  It is the Children{x
{wwho rule in Amadicia.  The Children allow the monarchy to continue in{x
{wAmadicia, largely to avoid ceremonial duties.  The current ruler, King{x
{wAilron, actually does have some small amount of power; this power will only{x
{wlast as long as he does not go against the wishes of the Children, of{x
{wcourse.  {x
 
{wThe capital city is Amador, which is also the location of the Fortress of{x
{wthe Light.  All know that it is the Fortress which holds the real power in{x
{wAmadicia, not the King's Serenda Palace.  {x

{wChanneling is outlawed in Amadicia, at order of the Children, causing Aes{x
{wSedai to avoid the country if at all possible.  Even if they did not{x
{wchannel, their ageless features would undoubtedly bring them unwanted{x
{wattention.  {x
 
{wAes Sedai are not the only ones who avoid Amadicia whenever possible. {x
{wAmadicia's harsh laws serve to frighten away common criminals, such as{x
{wthieves.  A person is branded the first time they are caught stealing, loses{x
{wa hand for the second, and is hanged after their third offense.  {x
 
{wAmadicia, as a nation, plays little role in the politics of the world.  The{x
{wChildren, however, are another matter.  Children of the Light can be found{x
{win virtually every nation, and also present a sizable military presence in{x
{wthe land.  All rulers know that dealing with Amadicia truly means dealing{x
{wwith the Children of the Light.{x

{WTar Valon{x
 
{wThe city of Tar Valon, nestled on an island in the River Erinin, is probably{x
{wthe center of politics in the world.  Tar Valon is independent of any{x
{wnation, as it is the location of the White Tower.  The White Tower,{x
{wnaturally, is the center of Aes Sedai authority.  As such, it is certainly{x
{wthe more important politically than any nation's capital.  {x
 
{wTar Valon is regarded as the premier work of the Ogier masons, though{x
{wCaemlyn is a close second.  Buildings flow organically from one to the next,{x
{weach building created to accent those around it.  The beauty of Tar Valon is{x
{wdominated by the White Tower itself, rising high above the city.  {x
 
{wBeing the political center that it is, Tar Valon is also a wealthy city.  It{x
{wis filled with merchants and shops, catering to the wealthy citizens of this{x
{wrichest of cities.  Despite the wealth evident in the city, crime is{x
{wunknown.  Those caught stealing are sent to the Tower where a sister has a{x
{wlittle talk with the thief; these thieves are seldom caught a second time. {x
 
{wWhile there are many who fear or even dislike the Aes Sedai who hold sway in{x
{wTar Valon, none can deny the beauty of this city.  The Ogier truly outdid{x
{wthemselves in its construction, and any traveler would do well to make a{x
{wstop in Tar Valon.   {x

{wA short distance to the east of Tear lies the small city-state of Mayene.{x
{wMayene claims independence, but the High Lords of Tear deny this, claiming{x
{wthat Mayene is a province of Tear.  {x
 
{wDespite these claims, no Tairen knows the location of the secret oilfish{x
{wshoals which are the source of Mayene's wealth and fragile hold on{x
{windependence.  And the Mayeners plan to keep it this way.  The oil which the{x
{wMayeners produce serves as lamp oil and competes with similar products from{x
{wTear, Illian, and Tarabon.  {x
 
{wThe ruling family of Mayene claims to be the direct descendants of Artur{x
{wHawkwing and still go by the Paendrag name.  Mayene's ruler is called "the{x
{wFirst."  These rulers have struggled for generations to keep Mayene{x
{windependent from its much larger neighbor.  {x
 
{wOne great tool the Mayener rulers used to maintain Mayene's autonomy was a{x
{wter'angreal doorway which took them to the land of the Aelfinn and Eelfinn. {x
{wThey were allowed to ask any three questions, and receive three true{x
{wanswers.  These answers were a great aid to the Firsts in maintaining{x
{wMayene's independence from Tear.  But this advantage was given away by a{x
{wyoung ruler who gave away the ter'angreal to the Tairens as a sign of good{x
{wwill.  He had already used it, and so it was no longer of any use to him.  {x
 
{wDespite this loss, Mayene has remained independent for hundreds of years. {x
{wThis small city-state faces a constant challenge from the bulk of Tear to{x
{wthe west, but the Mayeners are intent on remaining apart from the High Lords{x
{wof Tear.   {x

{WFar Madding{x
 
{wLocated in the Plains of Maredo, Far Madding was the main city in the long{x
{wdisappeared nation of Maredo.  It is now ruled by the Counsels, where the{x
{wtitle of First Counsel is given to the "first among equals."  There are{x
{wthirteen Counsels (including the First Counsel), all women and the majority{x
{waged.  They originally were the advisors to the Queens of Maredo but took{x
{wover once Maredo was "dissolved."  {x
 
{wFar Madding is a center for trade.  There are three main markets: The{x
{wAvharin Market, the Amhara Market and the Nethvin Market.  The largest of{x
{wthese is the Avharin Market.  The central focus of the square is a statue of{x
{wa woman called Einion Avharin which points toward Caemlyn.  The city acts as{x
{wa meeting place for Andoran, Tairen, and Illianer merchants; consequently,{x
{wits inns are always full of such folk.  However all the more important{x
{wpeople in Far Madding have large houses or palaces in an area called the{x
{wHeights that overlooks the Hall of the Counsels.  {x
 
{wSecurity in Far Madding is very tight.  The city itself is on an island in{x
{wthe middle of a lake with only three bridges connecting to the mainland. {x
{wThese are the Ikane, Ajalon and Goine bridges that lead eventually to{x
{wIllian, Andor and Tear respectively.  At each bridge every man with a weapon{x
{wmust have it 'peace bonded' by law.  This consists of a complex net woven{x
{waround the blade.  If the bonds are found to have been tampered with or{x
{wbroken then the person owning the weapon can be thrown in prison. {x
{wAdditionally, names are taken of all people entering the city.  But setting{x
{waside all these precautions, there is something much more impressive within{x
{wFar Madding, and that is the Guardian*.  {x
 
{w* The Guardian is a ter'angreal, or perhaps even two, that creates two{x
{wartificial stedding.  The larger affects male channelers and the smaller,{x
{winner one affects females.  If someone channels outside the city, the{x
{wGuardian can also pinpoint the location of the source by use of{x
{wtriangulation.  It can differentiate between saidar and saidin as well.  The{x
{wactual ter'angreal is set in the floor in the Hall of the Counsels.  An{x
{warrow in the center of the display used for locating use of the One Power{x
{wchanges color according to the nature of the Power used: black for saidin{x
{wand red for saidar.  {x
 
{wNevertheless, as with everything, the Guardian has weaknesses.  These have{x
{wonly recently been used and exploited through wells that enable the user to{x
{wstore limited amounts of the One Power to carry into the city.  This{x
{wloophole is effective for either half of the True Source.   {x

{CTer'angreal{x

{cTer'angreal are tools created during the Age of Legends that perform a
specific function.  Some of them had to be used with the One Power while
{x{cothers could just be touched, or used by anyone.  {x

{cAfter the Breaking, a few ter'angreal remain but for many, no one knows what
the original purposes for them were.  Research in this area are limited {x{cdue
to dangers that come with ter'angreal.  A few researchers have been killed
or burned out while studying, or working with them.  {x

{CSa'angreal{x

{cSa'angreal are objects like angreal that allow a person to channel more of
the One Power than they could unaided, but are much stronger, and rarer {x{cthan
angreal.  The making of them has been lost since the Age of Legends, but
some still exist, having been found again since the chaos of the {x{cBreaking. 
They are specific to men or women, though rumors exist of ones that can be
used by either.  It is not known if there is a continuous {x{cgradation between
angreal and sa'angreal, or if there is a discrete difference.  {x

{CAngreal {x

{cAn angreal is an object that allows a person to channel more of the One
Power than they would be able to unaided.  The making of them was lost
during {x{cthe Breaking, but individual angreal survived.  Though the general
population knows little of them, many of the stories about Aes Sedai feature
{x{cangreal, so their existence and the fact they help Aes Sedai do things they
couldn't otherwise, is generally known.  The Tower has a number of {x{cangreal
and by law considers all angreal to be their property.  {x {c Aes Sedai are
required to turn in any they find and punishment for not doing so {x{ccan be
quite severe and are kept with the sa'angreal in a secure storeroom.  They
come in a wide range of size and shapes, neither of which any {x{cguide to how
strong they are.  It is possible to use more than one angreal at the same
time, or at least to use an angreal and a sa'angreal {x{ctogether, the angreal's
strength just being added on top.  {x

Allorallen Road is a broad tree-lined boulevard that has been constructed
using strangely-shaped slabs of grayish-black stone.  Despite the haphazard
nature of the avenue's paving, the road has been well maintained and smooth
to traverse by foot or by cart.  The road in general follows the course of
the tall gray walls that can be seen encompassing the city.  The buildings
that border this thoroughfare are a mixture of tall shops and houses but all
of them have been constructed from light colored stone and topped with
gently sloping roofs tiled with slate.

Intersection of {bA{Bll{bo{Bra{bl{Ble{bn R{Boa{bd{x and {gE{Ggo{gri{Gdi{gn R{Goa{gd{x~
The wide tree-lined boulevard known as Allorallen Road is intersected at
this point by a second boulevard called Egoridin Road.  Both thoroughfares
have been paved with irregularly-shaped slabs of blackish-gray stone and
even with the haphazard nature of the boulevards' paving, each of the roads
have been well looked after and smooth to traverse by foot or by cart.  The
tall buildings surrounding this intersection are mostly houses but there are
a few shops and taverns along this route too.  Regardless of their use, each
of the buildings have been made from pale colored stone and topped with
gently sloping slate-tiled roofs.

Allorallen Bridge is one of the many arched bridges constructed from gray
stone that span the River Dhagon.  The bridge shows some signs of wear and
tear however it has been as well maintained as the two sections of road that
the bridge links.  Tall shops and houses flank the road north of the bridge
and to the south lies the Winter Palace.

This is a broad tree-lined boulevard that has been built using
oddly-shaped slabs of dark gray stone.  Despite the seemingly random
placement of the avenue's paving, the road has been well cared for.  The
structures along the west side of the road are mainly halls, palaces and
other civic buildings.  Allorallen Road splinters off to the east,
approaching a tall set of gilded gates that have been built into a massive
gray stone wall that surrounds a gigantic bluish-gray fortress-like
structure.

Dhagon Park provides a little bit of greenery inside the pale stone urban
sprawl of Bandar Eban.  The park consists of a large area of grassy land
that is encompassed by a high wall made of rounded gray stone.  The land
slopes steeply downwards at this point towards the muddy bank of a river or
a canal.  There are several gray gravel paths that meander their way through
the park past topiaries of ships and dolphins mixed with a dazzling display
of blues by surrounding flowerbeds.  One of these paths leads north towards

Darmovan Bridge is the largest of the many arched gray stone bridges that
span the River Dhagon.  The bridge shows some signs of wear and tear however
it has been as well maintained as the two halves of the Darmovan Docks that
the bridge links.  This section of the river that the bridge is built over
is susceptible to the tidal flow and reeks of sour mud and rotting seaweed
at low tide.  On some occasions the river bed is completely exposed and it
is not unusual to find river craft grounded in the sticky mud.

Despite what the name of this tavern may suggest, the Old Seadog appears
to be a well kept establishment.  The wooden floorboards of the common room
are stained from spilt wine and ale which fills the air with a sickly odor. 
At one end of this room is a bar and at the opposite end of the room is a
stone fireplace that has some comfortable armchairs strategically placed
around it.  The rest of the floor space has been taken up by a small wooden
stage built against a wall and numerous circular tables and chairs which
have been neatly arranged around the room.

Despite being a rather shabby establishment, this tavern appears to be
popular with many of the people that work at the nearby docks.  There are
smoky oil lanterns hanging from the low timber rafters, casting a subtle
golden glow over the common room which smells strongly of tabac and ale. 
The walls have been left as bare pale gray stone but the timber floor has
been covered with a layer of sawdust.  A welcoming fireplace built from gray
stone sits at one side of the room while numerous barrels of ale, rum and
wine have been stacked against the opposite wall.

Most of Bandar Eban's trade with Katar is carried along the River Dhagon
by long barges that travel between the Domani cities.  The river gives an
excellent view of the city without having to become lost inside its
labyrinth-like system of streets and alleyways.  On either side of the canal
are the two the halves of the Darmovan Docks, the largest of the city's
docks.

This stretch of the River Dhagon flows below Darmovan Bridge, one of
Bandar Eban's many bridges.  The gray stone bridge is supported by four
arches but regardless of their low appearance they have been built high
enough to allow passage of the barges beneath it.  The bridge links the two
the halves of the Darmovan Docks together, the largest of the city's docks.

At this point the huge yet sluggish River Dhagon flows out into the Aryth
Ocean.  The icy gray ocean waters stretch out beyond the western horizon
although a couple of ships break up the monotony of the bleak seascape.  The
grand city of Bandar Eban lies to the east of this point, a collection of
pale stone buildings of varying hues bordered by gray stone docks and tall
city walls.

This is the eastern half of a large courtyard paved with white
cobblestones that lies inside the outer grounds of the Winter Palace.  The
border of the yard is marked out to the north and to the east by the icy
blue-gray stone walls of the palace and along the south by a large stable
that has been constructed from the same bizarre-looking stone.

The West Stable is a long building created from the same type of icy
bluish-gray stone that was used in the construction of the Winter Palace. 
Tall arched doorways mark the entrances into the separate stalls.  The west
end of the building is reserved for the storage of grooming equipment and
tack whilst the area at the opposite end of the building has been used to
store carriages.  A broad set of stable doors on the north side of the
building lead out into a white cobblestoned yard.

A robust timber platform braced with wooden beams acts as a hayloft
within one of the pale bluish-gray stone stable of the Winter Palace.  The
area under the gently sloping eaves has been used to store numerous bales of
hay and straw as well as large sacks filled with oats.  The only way out of
this hayloft is an iron-rung ladder fixed to the north wall that leads
through a hatch to the ground floor.

The Servants' Gatehouse is probably one of the busiest areas of the
Winter Palace.  It is a vast chamber made of pale blue-gray stone and white
cobblestones with two pairs of reinforced doors on the west side that are
wide enough to accommodate wagons through them.  A raised platform and ramp
that is also made of blue-gray stone has been built along the east of the
gatehouse and acts as a drop-off point for deliveries.  Also on the east
side of the chamber is third set of doors that can be accessed via the stone
platform.

In contrast with the stark and linear styling of the rest of the Winter
Palace, the Throne Room occupies a vast chamber of ice which looks almost
organic with its stylized curves carved into the bluish-gray tinted rock. 
The walls have been dressed to a polished finish, reflecting the light from
the mirrored lanterns that are held on silver sconces.  The strange
translucent tiling that covered the entire floor of the chamber creates a
strange watery rippling effect in the light.  There is a huge arched window
at the far end of the chamber filled with stained glass that depicts the
flag of Arad Doman, that bathing the chamber with surreal multicolored
light.

This is a broad unpaved thoroughfare that winds its way through grassy
plains and disappears into the horizon.  The road looks rutted and pitted
from heavy use by carts and wagons.  To the east small farms and homesteads
can be seen in the distance scattered around the plains but the largest
settlement visible from here is a large city surrounded by a tall gray stone
wall that lies on the northern horizon.

heavy use by wagons and carts.  A narrow road splinters off to the west down
a steep rocky embankment that leads onto a sandy beach.  To the east small

This is a narrow road that meanders its way down a gentle yet stony
incline along a cliff face.  The road appears to be the only viable route by
foot or by cart to travel from the sandy beach that lies at the bottom of
the road to the wide highway that is situated at the top of the cliff. 
Rough clumps of grass and straggly bushes have managed to spring up around
the edge of the road, adding a little color to a mostly gray area.

The southern entrance into Bandar Eban is a high archway built into the
gray stone walls that surround the coastal city.  On both sides of the city
wall the stonework following the edge of the archway has been carved with an

Here is a wide tree-lined avenue that has been paved with
irregularly-shaped slabs of dark gray stone.  Even with the haphazard nature
of the avenue's paving, the road has been well maintained and smooth to
traverse by foot or by cart.  The road generally follows the course of the
tall gray walls that can be seen encircling the city.  The buildings that
line this thoroughfare are a mixture of tall houses and shops but all of
them have been constructed from pale colored stone and topped with gently
sloping slate-tiled roofs.

Allorallen Road is a broad tree-lined boulevard that has been paved with
strangely-shaped slabs of blackish-gray stone.  Even with the haphazard
layout of the avenue's paving, the road has been well maintained and smooth
to traverse by foot or by cart.  The road follows the course of the tall
gray stone walls that surround the city.  The buildings that flank this
boulevard are a mixture of tall shops and houses but all of them have been
constructed from pale colored stone and topped with gently sloping roofs
tiled with slate.

to traverse by foot or by cart.  The road follows the course of the tall

been constructed from light colored stone and topped with gently sloping
slate-tiled roofs.

irregularly-shaped slabs of grayish-black stone.  Despite the haphazard
nature of the avenue's paving, the road has been well maintained and smooth
to traverse by foot or by cart.  The road generally follows the course of
the tall gray walls that can be seen surrounding the city.  There is a vast
building on the east side of the road that sticks out like a sore thumb
against the pale stone shops and houses that flank this avenue.

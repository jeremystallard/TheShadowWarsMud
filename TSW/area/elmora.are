long brown hair has been plated into thin intricate braids that hang almost
halfway down her back.  She is quite slender, almost spindly but has a way
of posturing to look bigger and more foreboding than she probably is.  Like
many of the other female residents of Elmora, this woman was an elaborately
embroidered dress and a thin cloth veil that obscures the lower half of her
ace, revealing only her sharp brown eyes.  Unlike the other female citizens,
this woman holds a gnarled wooden walking stick almost like a cudgel but
also proudly like a symbol of office.

{RAginor{r

The man called Aginor was the second most powerful of the male Forsaken and
came close to rivaling both Lews Therin and Ishamael in strength with the
One Power.  He was originally named Ishar Morrad Chuain, and was one of the
foremost biological scientists of the Age of Legends whose work mainly
concerned new variation of plant life, both as crops and as ornamentals.  He
did not ascribe to the widely held belief that everything worth discovering
had already been discovered.  

He was one of the first Forsaken to turn to the Great Lord of the Dark. 
Aginor apparently turned to the Shadow so he could perform the experiments
he wanted to.  Before turning to the Dark One, he was reprimanded several
times for performing unauthorized experiments.  He used his skills as a
biological scientist to help the Shadow tremendously.  It was Aginor who
created the Shadowspawn, the first of which were the Trollocs.  Some of his
creations are still very well known, such as the Draghkar, whilst some are
only known through historical records such as the Gholam and the Jumara.  {x

{RAsmodean

{rBefore turning to the Shadow, Joar Addam Nessosin was an accomplished
musician.  A child prodigy, who was accomplished at both composition and
performance, he never fully fulfilled his childhood promise.  It was for
this reason that Asmodean turned to the Shadow.  With the promise of
immortality, he could eventually reach musical heights he was destined for. 

Asmodean was never a general for any army, though he did serve as a governor
of conquered territories.  Perhaps one of his greatest atrocities was the
revenge he took against the world's most famous musicians and artists. 
Asmodean had these artists maimed so they would never again be able to
perform their art before releasing them.  {x

{RBalthamel

{rBefore turning to the Shadow, Eval Ramman was a historian, unable to
distinguish himself enough to earn the coveted third name.  He specialized
in the study of vanished cultures, but his work was not outstanding.  Eval
Ramman had a bad temper which almost caused him to be bound with the One
Power to prevent him from doing something violent.  

He enjoyed consorting with the lower elements of society, and was very
popular with the women.  Perhaps the only reason he did not lose his job was
his great strength with the One Power.  The man to be known as Balthamel
went to the Shadow for the simple promise of immortality.  

Balthamel might have run an intelligence network which competed with that
run by Moghedien.  One of his most prominent atrocities was setting up camps
to breed humans as food for the Trolloc armies which were ravaging the land.

{RBe'lal

{rBe'lal, the Envious, is certainly the Forsaken of whom the least is known. 
A master of manipulation, his reputation led him to be known as the
Netweaver.  Originally he was Duram Laddel Cham.  Little is known of
Be'lal's life before he turned to the Shadow.  Some records indicate that
he, like Sammael had been one of the leaders in the fight against the
Shadow.  He went over to the Shadow during the Collapse although it is not
known whether or not he joined at the beginning or the end.  

Be'lal was a better manipulator than Rahvin and more skillful than Sammael
in dealing with enemies in open conflict.  For this reason Be'lal was an
extremely dangerous adversary.  Be'lal is suspected to be among those who
razed the Hall of the Servants days before the Bore was sealed.  {x

{RDemandred

{rDemandred was originally known as Barid Bel Medar.  Barid Bel Medar could
have been the most influential and acclaimed man of his Age, if it were not
for Lews Therin.  He was born one day after Lews Therin, almost as powerful
as the Dragon and almost as skilled.  In the end it was because of his envy
of Lews Therin that Demandred turned to the Shadow.  

During the War of Power, Demandred finally discovered something at which he
was at least the equal of Lews Therin - as a military commander in the fight
against the Shadow.  When Lews Therin was named commander of the forces
opposing the Shadow, Demandred was furious.  He believed himself the
intellectual superior to the Dragon.  He made the cold calculation that with
Lews Therin commanding the forces opposing the Shadow, the Shadow would win.
It was then that Demandred then decided to side with the Dark One.  {x

{RGraendal

{rGraendal is the most decadent of the Forsaken, wearing enormous gemstones
and barely transparent gowns.  Before she turned to the Shadow, Kamarile
Maradim Nindar lived a simple, ascetic life.  She was the Age of Legend's
equivalent of a psychologist, curing mental illnesses too extreme to be
Healed using the One Power.  Her gift did not stem from strength in the use
of the One Power; her true power was her keen insight into human motivation
and behavior.  

Though she was loved by the masses (most of them had only heard of her good
works), those who knew her personally tended not to get along well with
Kamarile.  She was highly critical of those who did not live up to her
standards; and as those standards were absurdly idealistic, she wound up
being disappointed by most people.  Within ten years after the Bore was
drilled Graendal adopted the decadent behavior that is now synonymous with
her name, becoming the opposite of all that she had been.  There is no
evidence to suggest that this change in behavior was caused by the Dark One.
Because the world failed to meet her standards she turned to the Shadow.  If
the world would not accept her guidance, she decided that she would lend her
incredible skills at manipulation to the Shadow.  

Although she led no armies for the Shadow, her considerable skill at
intrigue (and her unparalleled ability to use Compulsion) has aided the
Shadow immensely.  {x 
~

Page_07~
{RIshamael

{rIshamael means "Betrayer of Hope" in the Old Tongue.  Ishamael was among the
first, if not the first, to pledge his soul to the Dark One.  He was the
strongest of the Forsaken and was equaled by none but Lews Therin Telamon
himself.  Ishamael was also known as Ba'alzamon, Heart of the Dark, and Soul
of the Shadow.  Before turning to the Shadow, Ishamael's name was Elan Morin
Tedronai and he was a prominent philosopher of the time.  

After turning to the Shadow, Ishamael fought hard to convert Lews Therin to
the Shadow.  Some parts of articles that he wrote after turning to the
Shadow indicate his belief that the war between the soul of Lews Therin and
the Shadow had gone on since creation.  He viewed this as an endless battle
between the Creator and the Dark One, using human surrogates and that in
some previous turnings of the Wheel, Lews Therin's soul had become a
champion of the Dark One.  

It is believed by some that when Lews Therin and the Hundred Companions
sealed the Bore, Ishamael was not fully trapped.  According to the
speculations made by historian Aran son of Malan son of Senar (born circa
50AB), it may have taken many years for Ishamael to be drawn fully into the
trap that had imprisoned the other Forsaken when the Bore was sealed by Lews
Therin and the Hundred Companions.  If this was so then Ishamael may have
been thrown out of the prison at regular intervals.  Based on observations
made in his lifetime, Aran was unable to prove his theory although there
have been at least two periods of huge upheaval since the Breaking that
bears the hallmark of a Forsaken at work, the Trolloc Wars and the War of
the Hundred Years.  {x

{RLanfear

{rLanfear's original name was Mierin Eronaile.  Unlike the other Forsaken,
Lanfear chose her own name, which means "Daughter of the Night" in the Old
Tongue.  Mierin was extremely beautiful, possibly the most beautiful woman
of any Age.  She also became the most powerful female Forsaken, and the
second most powerful over all, topped only by Ishamael.  

Mierin worked at Collam Daan, the primary center for research into the One
Power.  Although Aes Sedai of the time could do things that are undreamt of
by today's Aes Sedai, Mierin and her colleagues chafed at the limitations
placed on their powers by the division between saidin and saidar.  The team
of researchers Mierin led believed that they had discovered a source of
power that could be wielded by either sex.  What they had actually
discovered, though, was a section of the Pattern where the "wall" of the
Dark One's prison had become dangerously thin.  Although she believed that
they were helping mankind with their work, Mierin led the group responsible
for drilling the Bore, the hole in the Dark One's prison.  All available
evidence suggests that Mierin was unaware of the effect that her actions
would have on the future of the world.  

Mierin and Lews Therin Telamon had once been in a serious relationship.  It
eventually became clear to Lews Therin that Mierin did not love him so much
as she loved being associated with him (and his considerable power).  When
he left her and married Ilyena Moerelle Dalisar, Mierin became increasingly,
and dangerously, obsessed with Lews Therin.  Or, more specifically, she
became obsessed with reclaiming the man that she felt had been stolen from
her.  It is most likely that Mierin's love (and hatred) for Lews Therin
drove her to swear to the Shadow.  

Lanfear never led any of the Shadow's armies, but she did serve as the
governor of many conquered territories.  The suicide rate was considerable
in all Shadow-controlled regions, but in Lanfear's territories it was above
average.  Her great skill in Tel'aran'rhiod allowed her to further the
Shadow's cause without ever entering a battle.  Her methods ranged from
inciting entire cities to riot against the established authority to
tormenting or assassinating an individual using the victim's own dreams
against him.  Suffice to say, those governed by Lanfear did not sleep
easily.  {x

{RMesaana

{rUnlike many of the people who would eventually become known as the Forsaken,
Saine Tarasind was not among the best in her profession.  Saine harbored
dreams of becoming a researcher since she had been very young.  But she was
turned down for a research position at Collam Daan; she ended up teaching
there instead.  Rather than making discoveries, she found herself teaching
about the discoveries of others.  

Unfulfilled, Saine turned to the Shadow.  Mesaana proved that she was an
adequate general, but was brilliant as a governor of conquered territory. 
Her administrations were efficient, and she started schools which taught
children to spy and report on each other.  These same children were
encouraged to destroy museums and other sources of ancient knowledge.  It
was important to root up and obliterate the old order, in preparation of the
Dark One's triumph.  {x

{RMoghedien

{rThe Spider was originally known as Lillen Moiral.  Lillen was an advisor for
investments, and was cautioned a number of times for violating the laws and
ethics of the business.  Moghedien turned to the Shadow long before the War
of Power actually began.  However, she joined Lews Therin's staff and gained
a position of high standing.  Several disasters early in the war were the
result of her work.  Some people, including some of the Forsaken, looked
down upon her for lurking in the shadows.  Moghedien resented this.  She ran
a very efficient intelligence and sabotage network, which was a great aid to
the cause of the Shadow.  Her greatest talent was her expertise in
Tel'aran'rhiod.  In the World of Dreams, she was unequaled, even by Lanfear.
While she most certainly could never have equaled Lanfear in the waking
world, in Tel'aran'rhiod Moghedien could have bettered the Daughter of the
Night.  {x

{RRahvin

{rVery little is known of Rahvin, both before the Collapse or when he became
one of the Chosen.  What is known was that his real name was Ared Mosinel. 
Under the Shadow he held both military commands and political office and
although he was a fair general, his talent was for political and diplomatic
affairs.  Rahvin's major weakness was his fondness for women and was also
susceptible to flattery.  People frequently rose quickly in his
administration by flattering him although he was quick to remove people who
were too unsuited for their duties.  One thing which is known for certain
about Rahvin is that he had a tendency to use Compulsion.  {x 
~
E
Page_12~
{RSammael

{rTel Janin Aellinsar was a world renowned sportsman, and was a good friend of
Lews Therin Telamon.  He was one of Lews Therin's best generals, and quickly
fell in love with war.  Most likely it was the honors and special privileges
which came with being a high ranking officer which he enjoyed the most.  Tel
Janin was always at his best when he was on the defensive, and the forces
opposing the Shadow were often on the defensive.  

He considered himself a much better general than the Dragon, and resented
the fact that Lews Therin had received the overall command of the forces
opposing the Shadow over himself.  Suddenly, during the middle of the war,
he turned to the Dark One.  Sammael believed that the forces of the Shadow
would inevitably win; he also had a very deep hatred of Lews Therin.  

Sammael wore a deep scar which was given him by Lews Therin.  While such a
scar could have easily been Restored (Healed) during the Age of Legends, he
chose not to.  Sammael was determined to wear it until he had defeated the
Dragon.  As a governor of conquered territories, his administrations were
terrible.  He paid no attention to the general population, and hunger and
disease were commonplace.  His armies, on the other hand, were well fed and
taken care of.  He did not want his armies to let him down when it was
important they perform well.  {x 
~

Page_13~
{RSemirhage

{rInitially known as Nemene Damendar Boann, the woman to be called Semirhage
was as well known for healing the body as Graendal was at healing the mind. 
She was frequently summoned to places all across the world to Heal people
who were out of the reach of most every other Aes Sedai in the world.  In
addition to being a Restorer, though, Nemene was also a sadist.  In return
for Healing her patients, she also gave them all a great deal of pain.  Few
complained, as pain was a small price to pay for still being alive.  When
the Hall of the Servants discovered what she was doing, they gave her two
choices.  One was to be bound with the Power against doing violence, the
other to be severed from the True Source.  Given those two options, she
chose a third - swearing to the Dark One at Shayol Ghul.  

Semirhage spent some time serving as both a general and a governor for the
Shadow.  Her reigns over conquered territory were particularly of a
particularly violent nature, even for one of the Forsaken.  It was Semirhage
that discovered that a circle of thirteen, with thirteen Myrddraal, could
turn an Aes Sedai to the Shadow against his or her will.  {x

{RTrollocs{x

{rTrollocs were initially created before the War of the Shadow when the Dark
One was in need of soldiers.  Scientists loyal to the Shadow, chief among
them Aginor blended the genetic material of humans and naturally aggressive
animals such as bears, boars, wolves, goats, wildcats, rams and eagles.  The
resulting man-beasts, each with a face and characteristics of the particular
animal it was crafted from were called Trollocs.  

Trollocs are large and power creatures approximately eight to ten feet in
height with the body of an overlarge, extremely muscular man.  They are
stronger than either the human or the animal of their heritage.  They are
omnivorous and will eat any kind of meat, including human flesh and the
flesh of other Trollocs.  Initially, however, the Trollocs were a failure in
terms of a potential soldier.  A lack of discipline and ability to take
orders, as well as a lazy and deceitful nature, prevented them from becoming
the effective warriors the Dreadlords had hoped to create.  

Trollocs organized themselves into tribes, and are the only creations from
the War of Power to have an organized social structure.  The chief tribes
are Ahf'frait, Al'ghol, Bhan'seen, Dha'vol, Dhai'mon, Dhjin'nen, Ghar'ghael,
Ghob'hlin, Gho'hlem, Ghraem'lan, Ko'bol and the Kno'mon.  

Only the males fight, with the females doing little but serving as breeding
machines.  The Trollocs do not always breed true.  Sometimes throwbacks to
the animal side are born, which die quickly.  Throwbacks to the human side,
called Myrddraal, usually survive.  {x 
~
E
Page_02~
{RMyrddraal{x

{r Myrddraals were not at first intentionally created, instead they were the
twisted offspring of Trollocs in which the human stock used in the creation
of the Trollocs has resurfaced but tainted by the evil used to create the
Trollocs.  They have tall, muscular bodies, and move with a serpent's speed
and grace.  Their skin is a pale white, and a Myrddraal could almost be
mistaken for a man except for the lack of eyes.  However, this lack does not
hinder them - they see like eagles in even the deepest night.  

The Myrddraal are able to disappear wherever shadows exist, and move to
another shadow far away.  None understand how this is done.  Aginor believed
that the Fades might be slightly shifted out of phase with reality.  Halfmen
appear as misty blurs in a mirror, and their dead black cloaks are not
touched by even the strongest wind.  Their only known weakness is running
water, which will cause an end to any casual pursuit.  

The eyeless gaze of a Fade inspires paralyzing fear in even the bravest of
warriors.  It is this ability to cause fear which makes them excellent
commanders of Trollocs.  In addition, the Myrddraal have the ability to link
with a number of Trollocs, taking control of their minds and wills. 
However, the death of this Myrddraal means the simultaneous deaths of all
the Trollocs it is linked to.  

The Myrddraal do not use the same crude weapons and armor as their Trolloc
parents.  Instead, they wear black plate armor, which enhances their
serpent-like appearance.  The Halfmen wield swords made at Thakan'dar, near
the entrance to the Pit of Doom.  Each sword is quenched in the tainted
streams of Shayol Ghul and seasoned with a human soul.  A wound inflicted by
one of these blades always proves fatal unless the One Power is used to Heal
the victim.  

The Myrddraal are known by many names, among them Shadowmen, Halfmen, Lurk,
the Eyeless, Fades, and Neverborn.  {x 
~
E
Page_03~
{RDraghkar{x

{rLike Trollocs, the Draghkar were deliberate creations incorporating the
corruption of human stock.  A Draghkar looks a great deal like an overly
tall man but their eyes are too large, and their skin too pale.  The
Draghkar appear to be wrapped in a black cloak, but this cloak is actually a
pair of bat-like wings.  

Unlike the Myrddraal and Trollocs, the Draghkar have little in the way of
fighting ability due to their frail nature.  Instead, the Draghkar use their
soft, hypnotic song to draw their prey to them.  Once the Draghkar have
their prey, they "kiss" them, slowly draining away the person's soul.  After
the soul has been devoured, the Draghkar then drains away life as well.  

People rescued from the clutches of a Draghkar are lifeless shells, with no
soul or personality left to them.  Once a Draghkar has a hold of someone, it
is probably best to let the Draghkar finish its work.  

Using their wings, the Draghkar are capable of flight so are used primarily
as outdoor assassins when their targets are alone.  They are less effective
as indoor or daylight assassins as they have a great difficulty gaining
access into sealed areas or dealing with groups of people or sunlight.  {x 
~
E
Page_04~
{RGray Men{x

{rUnlike other Shadowspawn, Gray Men are not constructs.  Instead, they are
men and women who did not mere pledge their souls to the Shadow as
Darkfriends did, they actually given their souls to the Dark One also
earning them the name of "Soulless".  

They are effective assassins as somehow this lack of a soul makes them seem
very ordinary and difficult to notice in a crowd.  Oftentimes the victim
never sees them coming.  There have even been instances where a Gray Man
killing someone in a crowd was never even noticed.  Even the most vigilant
of defenders can fail to notice a Gray Man, which would explain why they are
frequently used to attack important targets.  The Gray Men could be
considered the most dangerous of the Dark One's assassins.  

It is unknown what causes these men and women to give their souls to the
Great Lord of the Dark, as opposed to merely pledging to the Shadow as
typical Darkfriends do.  However, the number of Gray Men suggests that the
rewards for this sacrifice must be great indeed.  {x 
~

Page_05~
{RDarkhounds{x

{rNot all of the Shadowspawn were designed to with human features.  Darkhounds
were created using canine stock, possibly wolves, corrupted by the Shadow. 
The Darkhounds' only resemblance to a normal hound is the general shape. 
Darkhounds are darker than the night and as large as a pony.  They were
initially created as guard beasts during the War of Power.  Later, they were
later used to hunt down the Dark One's enemies.  

It is possible that much like the Myrddraal, the Darkhounds were slightly
shifted out of reality in their creation.  They leave no mark on even the
softest ground, yet leave footprints in the hardest stone.  Often the smell
of burning sulphur accompanies them.  Both the blood and saliva of a
Darkhound is highly toxic, toxic enough to cause a slow and agonizing death
with one drop on the skin.  

Darkhounds do not easily give up on a trail once on it.  The Darkhounds
dislike rain and thunderstorms, but this will not stop them once on the
trail of their quarry.  They are faster than horses, and can maintain their
speed longer than even the strongest horse.  Once a Darkhound is on the
trail, the only choice is to turn and kill it, or be killed.  

The only way to escape a Darkhound is to cross over running water -
Darkhounds do not like rain or thunderstorms and will not usually venture
into them.  They also refuse to cross flowing water of any kind.  Darkhounds
are among the most tenacious servants of the Shadow, simply not giving up
while they still breathe.  {x 
~

Page_06~
{RGholam{x

{rLittle information in the historical records remains about the Gholam apart
from that they most dangerous of all of Shadowspawn.  

The gholam were created by the Forsaken for one reason- to kill Aes Sedai. 
Only created six, because even the Forsaken feared the danger the gholam
presented.  Three of these gholam were created in the forms of women, three
in the forms of men.  

The gholam are dangerous because they are immune to the One Power.  Weaves
of the Power directed toward a gholam simply flow around them.  The danger
they present to Aes Sedai is obvious.  Stripped of their most potent
defense, an Aes Sedai would be vulnerable to a physical attack.  

But the gholam are dangerous in other ways.  They are fast, strong, and
cunning.  They are also flexible, able to slip under a doorway.  It would be
nearly impossible to defeat them in single combat, as normal weapons do not
seem to hurt them in any manner.  

It was generally thought that they were all destroyed or lost during the War
of Power or the Breaking of the World.  {x 
~
E
Page_07~
{RJumara{x

{rLike Gholam, little information in the historical records remains about the
Jumara.  A jumara is a worm-like Shadowspawn created by Aginor during the
War of Power, jumaras are one of the least known and perhaps one of the most
dangerous Shadowspawn ever made.  Their presence is familiar in the
Borderlands, where they are called Worms.  No jumara has been seen outside
of the Blight in recent times.  Their rarity is a blessing for the people of
the world.  A single jumara is said to be able to easily kill a Fade.  Worse
still, they travel in packs.  {x

{cWest Of Elmora{x~
This point along the dirt road provides not only an excellent vantage
point to the rolling countryside but also to see Elmora, a large walled town
belonging to Tarabon.  Founded upon a huge expanse of grassy plains nearby
to a wide river, Elmora is well situated to take advantage of its position
along the main trading route between the cities of Tanchico and Amador.  An
entrance into the town marked by a tall gate is almost a stone's throw away
to the east.

This is the West Gate, a large stone archway built into the protective
perimeter wall that surrounds the town of Elmora.  The way through the gate
can be barred by a tall wooden gate reinforced with iron.  Beyond the gate
to the east lies a wide thoroughfare paved with gray stone which leads
through the center of the town of Elmora.  On the west side of the gate the

This is a very broad thoroughfare paved with dull gray slabs of stone. 
The route looks well worn, rutted by the many wagons that have traversed
this road over the years.  Overlooking the street are numerous buildings
made of brick although some of the buildings' exterior walls have been
covered with white plaster.  Despite what they are constructed from, all of
the buildings within this town have flat tiled roofs.  One Elmora's largest
buildings can be seen across the road to the south, a tall inn known as the
Blazing Sun.

Elmora Plaza is a large paved area located in the center of the town,
bordered by tall buildings topped with flat tiled roofs.  At the center of
the plaza is a fountain carved from smooth milky white stone depicting a
woman holding an upturned urn; the stone almost seems to shimmer when under
light.  What appears to be the largest and grandest building in Elmora lies
beyond a gray stone wall that runs along the southern edge of the plaza, an
archway appears to be the only route to that building.

of Elmora appear mainly to be houses although there is the odd inn or shop
visible.  One building along the northern side of this road stands out from
all of the rest from its sheer size, a tall red brick inn.  The only visible
route to the inn from this point appears to be a large gateway built into a
tall brick wall that surrounds the inn.

This is a wide road that is overlooked along its west side by brick
buildings that are crowned with flat tiled roofs.  The thoroughfare looks
old and worn with many of its gray paving slabs bearing the scars of usage. 
The buildings within the immediate area appear mainly to be houses although
there is the odd shop or tavern to be seen.  Built along the east side of
the road is a short stone wall that appears to encompass a large area of
grassy land dotted with trees and bushes.  In the distance along this road
to the south is a tall rounded structure made of gray stone.

This is the end of a wide thoroughfare that is overlooked along its west
side by brick buildings crowned with flat tiled roofs.  The road looks old
and worn with its dull gray paving slabs bearing the scars of many years of
usage, namely potholes, ruts and loose slabs.  The buildings within the
immediate area appear mainly to be houses although there is the odd shop or
tavern to be seen.  Built along the east side of the road is a short stone
wall that appears to encompass a large area of grassy land dotted with trees
and bushes; a small iron gate built into the wall provides a route in and
out of the area.  The main focus of interest at this point however is a tall
cylindrical watchtower that stands to the south, directly overlooking where
this road ends abruptly.

Reeds grow in abundance along here, providing shelter for the many animals

quite closely although it bends sharply away just before a tall willow tree
and leads up the gentle slope towards a large red brick building to the

The garden is a large flat area of grassy land that is bordered by a
shirt red brick wall along three of its sides.  The eastern boundary of the
garden is marked by a tall red brick structure known as the Blazing Sun Inn.
Pretty flowers and shrubs have been planted alongside the brick wall whilst
a narrow gravel path winds its way through the middle of the garden and back
towards the side entrance of the inn.

It seems that almost every inch of this private dining room has been
scrubbed, polished or swept clean.  The area is brightly illuminated by a
brass lantern that hangs down from the ceiling.  Not a single blemish marks
the snowy white walls of the dining room; they appear to have been painted

large garden that is occupied by several wooden tables and benches.  The

This is the western end of a long corridor located somewhere within the
Blazing Sun, one of Elmora's largest inns.  Light is brought into this area
by a series of small brass lanterns that hang down from the ceiling.  The

wooden floorboards and matching paneling covering the lower half of the
walls.  The upper half of the walls of this dining room appears to have been

This is a large courtyard that is overlooked by three separate buildings.
The yard has been paved with large slabs of dull gray stone that have been
cut square in shape.  A short building stands at the northern end of the
yard; the stone from which it is constructed is much darker than the stuff
used to pave the yard.  The other two buildings that lie on the west and
south sides of the yard have both been constructed from red brick but the
western one is much larger.  The east side of the courtyard is bordered by a
tall red brick wall bisected by a wide iron gate that leads out into a wide
paved street.

plain fixtures upon gray stone walls although a large iron barred window on
the south side of the room do allow in some light during the day.  Despite

color created by the vibrant textiles and other materials used in the
creation of the clothing here.  The only visible exit in this workshop is a

{yA Cobbler's Workshop{x~
This is small, neatly kept workshop located somewhere within the town of
Elmora.  The workshop is brightly lit up by small lanterns that hang from
simple fixtures upon red brick walls although two small windows on the north
side of the room do allow in some light during the day.  The wooden boards
that make up the floor of the workshop have been recently swept clear of any
debris.  The only visible exit in this workshop is a large door on the
northern side of the room.

{RElmora Junk Shop{x~
Just like the merchandise displayed here, this junk shop is old and
dilapidated.  The white plaster that covers the walls of the room has turned
a pale shade of gray and large pieces of plaster have broken away.  The
wooden floorboards look grimy and not swept for at least a month.  There are
two main sources of light within this room, a rusty lantern hung from the
ceiling and a small window on the south side of the room.  Built next to the
window is a door leading out into the streets of Elmora.

{BA Fletcher's Workshop{x~
This building houses a small workshop belonging to a fletcher.  A large
yet dusty window on the northern side of the main workshop area allows some
light in during the day but the primary source of illumination here are the
lanterns which are hung from the ceiling's rafters.  The red brick walls of
the workshop seem relatively bare apart from a couple of wooden racks fixed
upon them, each one holding an assortment of tools.  A door on the northern
side of the room appears to be the main exit out of the workshop and outside
into the streets of Elmora.

This is the western side of a large expanse of grassy land that is dotted
with trees and bushes.  The western boundary is marked by a short wall that
has been constructed from rounded river stones.  A small iron gate built
into the wall provides a route in and out of the area, on this side of the
gate is a narrow muddy path that splits two ways leading deeper into the
park grounds, one path leads to the south whist the other one leads
northwards.  On the opposite side of the gate is a paved thoroughfare
overlooked by a row of brick buildings.

The narrow muddy path that snakes its way through Elmora Park is broken
at this point by a particularly wide yet slow flowing stream although the

the rest of this area is a tangled mess of brambles, briars and trees.  A
stone bridge has been built here to cross the old river at this point
although it now equally serves well to cross the stream.

The layout of the ground in this area suggests that there was once a very

whose source is slow flowing stream that flows in from the south.  A
multitude of smooth rocks and stones litter the ground near the banks of
both the stream and the pond.  Beyond the rocky debris is a steep grassy
incline that leads upwards to a thick copse.  Lily pads and thick clumps of

Visibility beneath the surface of the water is poor due to the amount of
silt being stirred up.  The ground at the bottom of the pond is a mixture of
soft clay-like sediment, gravel and other small pieces of debris that has
been washed into the slow flowing stream that feeds the pond to the south. 
A tangled mess of pond weeds have managed to take root within the soil,
providing the wildlife excellent places to dwell.

This is a large paved courtyard that is overlooked by a tall white
building on its southern side.  The building appears to be a large manor
house with tall arched windows and doors, white plaster covered walls and
roofs that are flat and covered in blue-gray slate tiles.  Despite the
building's size it appears to be of a very simplistic design which is
uncommon for such a construction within Tarabon.  The northern edge of the
courtyard is marked by a tall gray stone wall that is broken only by a gated
archway.  There are two gravel paths leading away from the courtyard, one to
the east and an almost identical one to the west.

chandeliers made from blackened iron.  The bottom half of the walls have
been covered with dark wooden panels that have been polished with beeswax
whilst the top half has been painted white.  A mossy green carpet covers the
floor of the library but at the center of the room is a large circular rug
that is a darker shade of green and made in a Tairen maze design.  Two tall
yet narrow windows on the eastern side of the room looks out onto the
streets of Elmora whilst to the north, south and west are identical doors
leading out of the room.

{DE{wl{Wmora Man{wo{Dr{x - {WA Long Hallway{x~
Contrary to its large size, this is a rather plainly decorated hallway
belonging to a manor house.  The area is lit up by very simple chandeliers
made from blackened iron.  The snowy white plaster walls of the room
contrast greatly with the dark wooden floorboards and the matching timber
beams that support the ceiling and the walls.  A faint scent of beeswax
permeates through the air; its origin is the carpentry within this room. 
Along this section of the hallway are several tall doors, each one made of
the same dark wood as the support beams.

behind the bar; each rack holds dozens of tankards of various shapes and
sizes.

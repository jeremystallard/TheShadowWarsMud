This is a small stable yard tucked away in a row of tall buildings on
Crown Road.  The yard is a rather plain and dull area that consists of hard
packed earth which is rutted and worn from carts and wagons parking in this
area.  The yard is surrounded along three sides by redbrick buildings
although only the ones on the east and south side of the yard can be
accessed from this point.  A tall brick wall has been built along the north
side of the yard; the wall is bisected by a wide iron gate provides an exit
back onto the streets of the New City.

inscription~
All hail me, the great Oniren.  

I have built on many muds under many names, some I cannot remember.  Among
the names of my aber/builder characters are:

{wA{Wn{Cg{Wu{wa{x {wY{Ws{Cab{Wel{wl{x {gTempleton{x {wSian{x {wLise{x

I have played under many names too but that is not important right now. 
What its important is that this is my largest area to date I have decided to
bestow this area with a little reminder to myself my old signature item, the
{gj{Ga{gde t{Gu{grt{Gl{ge{x.  

To those who know the significance of this particular item...  Moo!  

To those who do not know...  You probably do not know me anyway.

{wArafel is one of the Borderland nations that is devoted to protecting the
Blightborder.  It lies between Kandor to the west, and {x{wShienar to the east,
with the Blight to the north.  The eastern border between Arafel and Shienar
is formed by the Mora River {x{wand the southern border by the Erinin.  The
terrain of Arafel is much more rugged than that of its neighbor, Shienar,
and is at {x{wleast partly made up of grasslands.  Like all of the Borderlands,
Arafel became a nation near the beginning of the War of the {x{wHundred Years.  {x
{wThe governors of the five northern provinces met; the outcome of this
meeting was an agreement to form five {x{wstable nations.  The purpose of these
nations was to defend the rest of the continent against the Blight, and
therefore {x{wprotecting the peace of the land.  {x

{wNative Arafellins are characterized by their large eyes and pale skin.  The
men wear their hair long and in braids.  They usually {x{wattach silver bells to
the ends of their braids.  Some people consider the people of Arafel to have
a strange sense of honor {x{wand debts.  {x

{wKandor is one of the Borderland nations, dedicated to defending the
Blightborder.  It is situated between Saldaea and Arafel, with {x{wthe Blight to
the north.  At least part of Kandor is mountainous.  The capital city of
Kandor is Chachin, located in the {x{wmountains of Kandor.  The merchants of
Chachin have a good reputation and considerable wealth, even though the
city's nearness {x{wto the Blight prevents it from being a major trading city. 
Another well known city in Kandor is Canluum, with the town of {x{wRavinda
located between the two.  {x

{wKandori people can be easily recognized by the earrings that they wear. 
They are worn by both men and women, and can sometimes be {x{wquite
ostentatious.  Kandori men wear their beards in a distinctive forked style,
and often wear up to three silver chains over {x{wtheir coats.  Loose breeches
seem to be worn by both men and women alike, if anything can be told from
Birgitte's appearance {x{wand the fact that she claims to be Kandori.  {x

{wThere is not much specific information on the military of Kandor, but it is
known that the martial arts are just as highly {x{wdeveloped in Kandor as in the
other borderland nations.  The army of Kandor is most likely similar to
those of Arafel, Saldaea {x{wand Shienar.  {x

{WMalkier{x
{CSymbols: {cThe Seven Towers and the Golden Crane.  {x
{CCapital city: {cMalkier.  {x

{wMalkier was one of the twenty-four nations formed either during or shortly
after the War of the Hundred Years.  It was one of five {x{wBorderlands until it
fell to the Blight in the 950's NE.  It was located north of Shienar and
Arafel.  Malkier was known both {x{wfor the seven towers, and for it's necklace
of a thousand lakes.  The towers still stand today, broken and jagged, and
are {x{wcircled by the lakes.  Other locations in Malkier include Herot's
Crossing and the Stair of Jehaan.  {x

{wThe nation of Malkier was a monarchy, ruled by a King and Queen.  At any
given time, there are supposedly five Great Lords of {x{wMalkier.  In order to
name a new King, they must "cast the rods" and decide who is fit to be king.
In Malkier, unlike in some {x{wof the southlands, when a King is married, his
wife is crowned as Queen when they exchange rings.  Among the Malkieri, the
{x{wKings are denoted by the "al" before their first name, and the Queens by the
"el" before their first name.  {x

{wWomen in Malkier wear the ki'sain, a colored dot, on their forehead.  It
symbolizes their willingness to pledge their sons to oppose {x{wthe Shadow. 
Unmarried women wear a blue ki'sain, married women wear a red ki'sain, and
widows wear a white ki'sain.  {x {wMen wear a hadori, a thin, braided leather
cord, around their foreheads to hold their hair back.  {x {wOne of the other
customs of Malkier is that of a carneira.  The word "carneira" translates to
"first", and regards a person's first {x{wlover.  While young women chose their
own carneira, young men do not have a choice; their carneira chooses them. 
When a young {x{wman is chosen by his carneira, she will have him make a daori,
a long cord woven of his hair.  When the man is holding the {x{wdaori, his
carneira has the advantage over him; the daori must be taken from the person
by the carneira in order for this {x{wadvantage to be laid aside.  The daori is
presented by the carneira to the man's bride on his wedding day.  There is a
saying {x{wthat "a king is not a king, alone with his carneira".  {x {wMost of the
Malkieri that remain alive have assimilated themselves into other nations
and cultures, trying to forget the memories {x{wof Malkier.  {x

{wThere is little specific information on Malkier's army, but it can be
assumed, of course, that their army was very strong indeed.  {x{wBefoer the
destruction of Malkier Shienar was not considered to be a Borderland because
of Malkier.  While the men of Shienar {x{wrode forth to help protect the
Blightborder, it was Malkier who held back the Blight.  {x

{wThe largest of the Border nations, Saldaea is larger than Shienar and Arafel
combined.  The Saldaeans are known for their tilted, {x{walmond-shaped eyes. 
While as ferocious in battle as any of the Border nations, their equestrian
skills are undoubtedly {x{wsuperior.  The Saldaeans are the greatest light
cavalry in the world.  {x

{wFor Saldaeans, war is a family affair.  The wives of officers and nobles
accompany their husbands on all campaigns except those into {x{wthe Blight. 
While not trained with the sword, Saldaean girls are quite skilled both with
knives and in hand-to-hand combat.  {x{wAll Saldaeans are armed with at least a
knife at all times; in Saldaea, steel is not bared unless it will be used. 

{wThe Saldaean economy is strong.  Built upon the trade of furs, wood, and ice
peppers, Saldaean goods fetch high prices at markets as {x{wfar away as Tear.  {x

{wAnother important part of Saldaean life is the sa'sara, a dance outlawed by
several Saldaean queens for its indecency.  While known {x{wby virtually every
noblewoman, few would ever admit to the knowledge.  Apparently, the sa'sara
has the ability to drive men {x{wwild.  The sa'sara is known to have started
three wars and sparked two rebellions, among many other smaller
disturbances.  {x

{CCapital city:{c Fal Moran.  {x
{COther towns: {cFal Dara, Fal Eisen and Mos Shirare.  {x

{wIt is a tremendous struggle for the people of Fal Dara to live so close to
the Blight.  The constant fighting greatly affects the {x{wway the Shienaran
warriors view life.  The three most important values to the Shienaran
warriors are peace, beauty, and life.  {x{wPeace, because they have never known
it.  Beauty, because they are so near the corruption of the Blight.  Life,
because they are {x{wsworn to death.  {x

{wTo the Shienaran warriors, it is the quality of life that matters, not any
material wealth that is gained.  The soldiers are buried {x{wunclothed.  It is
their belief that all came from the earth, and they wish to return as they
came to the last embrace of the {x{wmother.  {x

{wThe Shienarans are the finest heavy cavalry in the world.  Like Fal Dara,
all of the towns in Shienar are built to function as {x{wfortresses.  All are
built on hills, to gain a commanding view of the countryside.  They are
surrounded by stone walls and heavy {x{wiron gates.  Nothing taller than short
grass is allowed to remain for at least a half-mile beyond the town walls. 
{x
{wShienar's capital city is Fal Moran.  However, it is the cities closer to
the Blightborder, such as Fal Dara, which more closely {x{wembody the fighting
spirit of Shienar.  Everything except the surrounding farms are enclosed
within the city walls.  Fal Dara, {x{wand the cities like it, were built for
strength and beauty.  {x

{wLike all cities along the Blightborder, no man may be permitted to wear a
hood or cover their face within the city walls.  This is {x{wan effort to
prevent Myrddraal from entering into the cities.  Also, the streets of these
cities are very well lighted, to try {x{wand prevent the shadows the Myrddraal
need to appear and disappear at will.  {x

{CBanner: {cTwo golden leopards on a field checked four-by four in red and blue,

{COther symbols: {cThe Throne of Winds and the Golden Leopards.  {x
{CCapital city:{c Ebou Dar.  {x
{COther towns: {cRemen.  {x

{wAltara lies between the more powerful nations of Illian and Amadicia. 
Altara itself is barely a unified nation, with most Altarans {x{wpreferring to
refer to themselves as subjects of one noble or another.  The only reason
Altara was not taken over during the {x{wWhitecloak War was the aid of Illian;
Illian intervened only to maintain Altara as a buffer between Amadicia and
itself.  {x

{wThe Altarans are a fierce, but polite, people.  This is most evident in the
prevalence of dueling in Altaran culture.  Most men and {x{wwomen have
participated in at least one duel by the time they reach adulthood, priding
themselves on their courage.  As in many {x{wother countries, men duel over the
rights to a woman, with the woman going to the victor.  Unique to Altara,
though, is women {x{wdueling over men.  The death of a man at the hands of a
woman is justified unless proven otherwise, which results in men {x{wtreating
these dangerous Altaran women with the utmost respect.  {x

{wNowhere is the Altaran nature more evident than the capital city of Ebou
Dar.  Ebou Dar is divided into two sections by the River {x{wEldar.  The west
side is filled palaces and large buildings.  All of these buildings are
pale, made of white rock or lightly {x{wcolored marble.  The west side of the
city is surrounded by a large, thick wall.  {x

{wThe east side of Ebou Dar is known as the Rahad.  The Rahad, poorer than the
western portion of the city, is filled with lightly {x{wcolored buildings,
painted white to resemble the richer buildings on the opposite side of the
river.  The streets are more {x{wlikely to be alleys, and are filled with a much
rougher population than the west side of the city.  Duels are an hourly
{x{woccurrence, and those foolish enough to wear fine clothes into the Rahad are
often killed for them.  {x

{wAltara is a nation weakened by a lack of unity, and is available for the
taking by a nation powerful enough to seize it.  {x

{wArad Doman plays a rather minor role in the politics of the land.  It is has
long maneuvered to gain control of Almoth Plain, with {x{wTarabon similarly
trying to gain control of this piece of land.  {x

{wDomani women are the source of the nation's fame, as only the Sea Folk women
are more graceful.  Domani women wear clothes {x{wconsidered scandalous in most
countries, and have raised the practice of seduction to an art.  Mothers
begin teaching their {x{wdaughters this art at an early age.  {x

{wIf Arad Doman owes its fame to its women, it similarly owes its national
wealth to them.  Most Domani merchants are women, and few {x{wmen come out on
top after a bargaining session with a Domani woman.  Most men, however,
consider losing to be worth the {x{wexperience.  {x

{wThe capital of Arad Doman is Bandar Eban, which also serves as a center of
trade.  The Domani trade a great deal with the Sea Folk, {x{wand are among the
few merchants in the land who can hold their own against in bargaining with
the Sea Folk.  {x

{WIllian{x
{CBanner: {cNine golden bees on a field of green.  {x
{COther symbols: {cThe Laurel Crown and the Golden Bees.  {x
{CCapital city: {cIllian.  {x

{wIllian is a strong nation on the Sea of Storms.  It has grown rich on the
trade that flows into the nation by river and sea.  Illian {x{whas a very solid
relationship with neighboring Altara.  It was Illian that protected Altara
during the Whitecloak War, seeking {x{wto maintain Altara as a buffer between
itself and Amadicia.  {x

{wIllian is not governed solely by the King.  Illian also has an advisory
Council of Nine, made up of nine nobles.  Additionally, the {x{wAssemblage, also
an advisory entity, is made up of the richest merchants and traders in the
kingdom.  {x

{wThe King and the Council of Nine have struggled for power since the nation
of Illian was established.  The first King told the first {x{wCouncil that they
could have any palace, so long as it was not larger than his own.  So the
Council proceeded to erect a palace {x{widentical to the King's, but smaller in
every dimension by one foot.  These two palaces, standing on opposite sides
of the {x{wgreat Square of Tammaz, exemplify the power struggle that is the
Illianer government.  {x

{wOf course, the Assemblage also seeks to add to its own power.  This power
struggle makes the Illianer government slow and {x{wineffective, leaving most
Illianers to live as they wish.  {x

{wOne legendary item of history has special ties with Illian - the Horn of
Valere.  The first Hunt of the Horn in Illian was called {x{wbetween the Trolloc
Wars and the War of the Hundred Years.  Another Hunt was recently called in
Illian, and heroes came to seek {x{wthe Horn or at least a place in history.  {x

{wThough Illian's military might is formidable, its finest soldiers are those
within the elite unit called the Illianer Companions.  {x{wThese crack troops
traditionally ride with the commanding general during any military action,
to be deployed wherever their {x{wextraordinary abilities are needed, usually in
the hottest fighting.  During the Whitecloak War, the Children of the Light
set {x{wa trap at Soremaine that caught King Stepeneos and would have destroyed
his entire army if it were not for the valour of the {x{wCompanions.  They held
the field long enough to allow the rest of the army to escape to safety, and
thus prevented Altara, as {x{wwell as Murandy and Illian, from falling under the
{wsway of the Whitecloaks.{x

{COther towns:{c Elmora.  {x

{wThe people of Tarabon like to refer to themselves as the Tree of Man, and
claim to be the descendants of the nobles and rulers of {x{wthe Age of Legends. 
Early in its history, it is believed that Tarabon possessed either a branch
or a living sapling of {x{wAvendesora, the Tree of Life.  {x

{wTarabon has squabbled with Arad Doman throughout its history for the
possession of Almoth Plain.  Only recently, though, has this {x{wconflict
evolved into actual war.  Tarabon was once a powerful nation, with a strong
economy and great political influence.  {x{wRecently Tarabon has fallen on hard
times, with a faltering economy and diminishing power in the world.  {x

{wTarabon is ruled in a very unique way, jointly by a king and a panarch.  The
election of these two rulers is the only real function {x{wof Tarabon's Assembly
of Lords.  The King is responsible for spending revenue, controls the army,
and oversees the High Court.  {x{wThe Panarch collects revenues, commands the
Civil Watch, and is in charge of the lower courts.  {x

{wTanchico is the capital city of Tarabon, and is one of the oldest surviving
cities on the continent.  Some historians claim that {x{wparts of the Panarch's
palace was built during the Age of Legends.  Tanchico itself is larger than
cities such as Tear and {x{wCaemlyn, and is a great center of trade and
entertainment.{x

{CBanner: {cThree white crescent moons across a half red, half gold field.  {x
{COther symbols:{x {cThe Crescent Moons and the Stone of Tear.  {x
{CCapital city: {cTear.  {x
{COther towns: {cGodan.  {x

{wTear is one of the richest nations in the land.  This comes in part from
controlling the greatest port on the Sea of Storms.  A great {x{wdeal of Tear's
wealth comes from the oil produced on the country's numerous olive farms. 
Lucrative trade in grain and fish {x{walso brings money into rich nation of
Tear.  {x

{wHowever, it is only the nobles of Tear who have grown rich off the nation's
vast wealth.  This is because of the view unique to {x{wTairen lords that
commoners are actually lesser beings.  The distinction between Tairen lords
and commoners is a sharp one, to {x{wthe point where they even dress
differently.  Until very recently, it was not even possible for a commoner
to call a noble {x{wbefore a magistrate.  {x

{wUnlike most nations, Tear is not ruled by a king or queen.  Instead, Tear is
ruled by the High Lords.  The number of High Lords has {x{wvaried over time from
six to twenty, but they are always of a particular rank.  {x

{wThe city of Tear goes further in enforcing the differences between commoners
and nobles.  The inner city is surrounded by a high {x{wwall of gray stone. 
Within the wall are the finer houses and palaces of the nobles, which line
streets paved with stone.  {x{wOutside the wall, commoners trudge through
unpaved, muddy streets.  {x

{wThe city of Tear is dominated by the Stone of Tear, which towers above the
city like a small mountain.  It is believed to be the {x{woldest stronghold of
mankind, erected shortly after the Breaking of the World.  It was built with
the One Power, Earth, Air, {x{wand Fire fusing stones together without joint or
mortar.  {x

{wDeep within the Stone is the Heart of the Stone.  This is where the great
sword Callandor is held, protected by the One Power.  {x{wCallandor is actually
one of the greatest sa'angreal ever, waiting for the Dragon Reborn to claim
it.  No one except the High {x{wLords are allowed to enter the Heart, and even
they rarely enter it.  The High Lords only enter the Heart four times a year
for {x{wthe Rite of Guarding, and to raise a lord to a High Lord.  Indeed, if
the High Lords could manage to forget that the Heart of {x{wthe Stone and
Callandor existed, they undoubtedly would.  {x

{wThis is due partly to the fact that it is prophesied that the Stone will not
fall until the Dragon has been Reborn.  The High Lords {x{wlike to think that by
protecting Callandor, they are protecting the world from the Dragon Reborn. 
{x
{wAlso, Tairens fear anything to do with the One Power.  Aes Sedai are
forbidden to channel while in Tear.  The Stone also houses a {x{wcollection of
angreal and ter'angreal second only to the White Tower.  It is unsure
exactly why the Tairens have collected such {x{wan array; perhaps to prevent
their use by Aes Sedai, or maybe to ease the knowledge that they possess the
greatest of them, {x{wCallandor.  {x

{wThe capital city is Amador, which is also the location of the Fortress of
the Light.  All know that it is the Fortress which holds {x{wthe real power in
Amadicia, not the King's Serenda Palace.  {x

{wChanneling is outlawed in Amadicia, at order of the Children, causing Aes
Sedai to avoid the country if at all possible.  Even if {x{wthey did not
channel, their ageless features would undoubtedly bring them unwanted
attention.  {x

{wAes Sedai are not the only ones who avoid Amadicia whenever possible. 
Amadicia's harsh laws serve to frighten away common {x{wcriminals, such as
thieves.  A person is branded the first time they are caught stealing, loses
a hand for the second, and is {x{whanged after their third offense.  {x

{wAmadicia, as a nation, plays little role in the politics of the world.  The
Children, however, are another matter.  Children of the {x{wLight can be found
in virtually every nation, and also present a sizable military presence in
the land.  All rulers know that {x{wdealing with Amadicia truly means dealing
with the Children of the Light.  {x

{COther towns: {cBaerlon, Whitebridge, Aringill and Fourkings.  {x

{wAndor is the largest nation in the land, and is one of the oldest as well. 
It was founded during the War of the Hundred Years.  Many {x{wof Andor's
traditions were established during these early years.  Unlike many nobles of
the time, Queen Ishara, Andor's first {x{wruler, knew that no one ruler would be
able to take control of Hawkwing's entire empire.  Instead, she focused on
controlling {x{wonly what she could.  As a result, Andor began only with the
capital city of Caemlyn and the small surrounding villages.  {x{wCautious
expansion marked the reigns of the early queens of Andor.  {x

{wThe oldest tradition of Andor is that only a queen must sit on the Lion
Throne of Andor, and wear the Rose Crown.  The eldest {x{wdaughter is known as
the Daughter-Heir, and is always sent to Tar Valon to study.  The eldest
brother of the Daughter-Heir is {x{wsworn to protect her with his life, and is
prepared from an early age to take control of Andor's army.  {x

{wCaemlyn is the capital city, second in beauty only to Tar Valon.  The city
of Caemlyn is actually made up of two cities, the New {x{wCity and the Inner
City.  The New City is less than two thousand years old, constructed
exclusively by humans.  The ancient {x{wInner City, on the other hand, was
constructed by Ogier.  The entire city is encircled by a fifty-foot wall;
the Inner City {x{witself is also surrounded by a wall.  Certainly the most
impressive building in the Inner City is the Royal Palace, which {x{wserves as
the seat of government for Andor.  {x

{wAndor is a strong nation, backed by a strong army consisting primarily of
the Queen's Guards.  Andor has always been under almost {x{wconstant pressure
from neighboring countries.  Andor and Cairhien have to been to war more
times than any two countries except {x{wfor Tear and Illian.  Similarly, the
Children of the Light have always had a reason to dislike Andor, as the
queen always {x{wstudies in the White Tower.  {x

{wAndor's strength comes from its wealth.  Much of this is generated in the
Mountains of Mist, far to the west of central Andor.  Gold, {x{wsilver, iron,
and copper are extracted from the rich mines in these mountains.  Most of
this metal is refined in the smelters {x{wnear the mines.  {x

{wMost of the iron, however, is sent to the Baerlon Ironworks, famous
throughout the land for the quality of its work.  The last {x{wseveral Queens
have had trouble controlling this region, however.  Luckily for these
Queens, the metal coming out of Baerlon {x{wmust travel through the rest of
Andor to reach the rest of the land.  This might be the only thing that
allows the crown to {x{wretain control of an area so important to its economy. 

{wThe strength which must be expended to retain the valuable mines in the
Mountains of Mist means that other outlying regions of {x{wAndor have been
virtually forgotten.  A good example of this is the Two Rivers, where few
even realize they are part of a {x{wlarger kingdom.  One well-known town in the
far west of Andor is Whitebridge, so named for the large bridge which
crosses the {x{wRiver Arinelle into the town.  {x

{CCapital city: {cCairhien.  {x
{COther towns: {cTaien and Jurene.  {x

{wCairhien, like many of the current nations, became sovereign at the end of
the War of the Hundred Years.  The nation of Cairhien now {x{wspreads over less
than half the land it once controlled.  {x

{wThe Cairhienin had a period of four hundred years in which they enjoyed a
period of unprecedented wealth.  This was brought about by {x{wthe Aiel's
granting of the right to cross the Aiel Waste and trade for silk in Shara. 
This prosperity ended when Laman {x{wDamodred cut down Avendoraldera and
unknowingly sparked the Aiel War.  It was during this war that the city of
Cairhien was {x{wburned to the ground.  {x

{wThe politics of Cairhien are dominated by the Great Game, the Game of
Houses.  The nobles took the plotting and intricacies of life {x{wwithin the
White Tower, and gave it their own twist.  Also called Daes Dae'mar, it is
responsible for almost every major {x{wdisaster in Cairhien's history.  To the
Cairhienin, everyone has a hidden motive, every word has another meaning. 
Everything is {x{wbelieved to be a move to gain more power and strength.  {x

{wThe Cairhienin are a very reserved people.  They also prefer complete
control over their environment.  This can be seen in the layout {x{wof the city
of Cairhien, which is a precise grid pattern, all streets meeting at right
angles.  {x

{wThe only time the Cairhienin reserve breaks is during the Feast of Lights. 
During this two day celebration, all social barriers {x{wfall.  Any man may kiss
any woman, and any woman may kiss any man.  After the two days are over,
life precedes as if nothing had {x{woccurred.  {x

{wGhealdan is a relatively small nation, lying between Garen's Wall and the
Mountains of Mist, bordering Amadicia to the south along {x{wthe River Eldar and
Altara to the east.  To the north lie the Forest of Shadows, the
Manetherendrelle and a short, almost {x{wimpassable border with Andor.  {x
{wAccording to the maps, Ghealdan is entirely made up of land formerly claimed
by Dhowlan.  Most maps show it as taking most of that {x{wland, but others shows
it as taken virtually all, with essentially none of the land having been
part of other countries.  Apart {x{wfrom a small part of what was Eharon during
the time of the Compact of the Ten Nations, the land that is now Ghealdan
was part {x{wof the nation of Manetheren.  {x

{wThe main military group in Ghealdan is the Legion of the Wall.  {x

{wPeople in Ghealdan are often wary of strangers.  Little is known of the
dress and appearance of Ghealdanin, though they tend to be {x{wdark of hair and
eye.  {x

{COther symbols: {cThe Red Bull.  {x
{CCapital city: {cLugard.  {x
{COther towns:{c Inishlinn and Mindea.  {x

{wThe people of Murandy, much like the people of Altara, do not really
considers themselves the residents of a nation.  They are more {x{wlikely to
claim allegiance to one or another of the local lords.  {x

{wThe ruler of Murandy seldom controls events outside of the capital city of
Lugard.  Even within Lugard, the monarch is sometimes {x{whelpless to affect the
course of events.  The only reason a monarch is tolerated in Murandy is as a
deterrent to incursions by {x{wforeign nations.  {x

{wThe capital city of Lugard is located in central Murandy, and it is the
trade flowing through Lugard which keeps Murandy alive.  {x{wDespite whatever
political conflict might be disrupting daily life in Murandy, trade
continues to flow through Lugard.  It is {x{wone of few cities which has more
inns and stables than residences and shops.  {x

{wLugard was once surrounded by a tall stone wall, but it has since crumbled. 
In many places around the city, piles of rubble mark {x{wwhere the wall once
stood.  The many thieves who call Lugard home consider any foreigner a fair
mark, and the unpaved roads and {x{walleys are frequently dangerous to travel
alone.  {x

{wMurandy plays a minor role in world politics.  The lack of an effective
ruler makes it difficult for Murandy to defend itself, much {x{wless to make its
presence felt in the rest of the land.  {x

{WFar Madding{x

{wLocated in the Plains of Maredo, Far Madding was the main city in the long
disappeared nation of Maredo.  It is now ruled by the {x{wCounsels, where the
title of First Counsel is given to the "first among equals."  There are
thirteen Counsels (including the {x{wFirst Counsel), all women and the majority
aged.  They originally were the advisors to the Queens of Maredo but took
over once {x{wMaredo was "dissolved."  {x

{wFar Madding is a center for trade.  There are three main markets: The
Avharin Market, the Amhara Market and the Nethvin Market.  The {x{wlargest of
these is the Avharin Market.  The central focus of the square is a statue of
a woman called Einion Avharin which {x{wpoints toward Caemlyn.  The city acts as
a meeting place for Andoran, Tairen, and Illianer merchants; consequently,
its inns {x{ware always full of such folk.  However all the more important
people in Far Madding have large houses or palaces in an area {x{wcalled the
Heights that overlooks the Hall of the Counsels.  {x

{wSecurity in Far Madding is very tight.  The city itself is on an island in
the middle of a lake with only three bridges connecting {x{wto the mainland. 
These are the Ikane, Ajalon and Goine bridges that lead eventually to
Illian, Andor and Tear respectively.  At {x{weach bridge every man with a weapon
must have it{x {w'peace bonded' by law.  This consists of a complex net woven
around the blade.  If the bonds are found to have been tampered with or
{x{wbroken then the person owning the weapon can be thrown in prison. 
Additionally, names are taken of all people entering the {x{wcity.  But setting
aside all these precautions, there is something much more impressive within
Far Madding, and that is the {x{wGuardian*.  {x

{w* The Guardian is a ter'angreal, or perhaps even two, that creates two
artificial stedding.  The larger affects male channelers and {x{wthe smaller,
inner one affects females.  If someone channels outside the city, the
Guardian can also pinpoint the location of {x{wthe source by use of
triangulation.  It can differentiate between saidar and saidin as well.  The
actual ter'angreal is set in {x{wthe floor in the Hall of the Counsels.  An
arrow in the center of the display used for locating use of the One Power
changes {x{wcolor according to the nature of the Power used: black for saidin
and red for saidar.  {x

{wNevertheless, as with everything, the Guardian has weaknesses.  These have
only recently been used and exploited through wells that {x{wenable the user to
store limited amounts of the One Power to carry into the city.  This
loophole is effective for either half {x{wof the True Source.  {x

{CBanner: {cA golden hawk in flight on a field of blue.  {x
{COther symbols: {cThe Golden Hawk.  {x

{wA short distance to the east of Tear lies the small city-state of Mayene. 
Mayene claims independence, but the High Lords of Tear {x{wdeny this, claiming
that Mayene is a province of Tear.  {x

{wDespite these claims, no Tairen knows the location of the secret oilfish
shoals which are the source of Mayene's wealth and fragile {x{whold on
independence.  And the Mayeners plan to keep it this way.  The oil which the
Mayeners produce serves as lamp oil and {x{wcompetes with similar products from
Tear, Illian, and Tarabon.  {x

{wThe ruling family of Mayene claims to be the direct descendants of Artur
Hawkwing and still go by the Paendrag name.  Mayene's ruler {x{wis called "the
First."  These rulers have struggled for generations to keep Mayene
independent from its much larger neighbor.  {x

{wOne great tool the Mayener rulers used to maintain Mayene's autonomy was a
ter'angreal doorway which took them to the land of the {x{wAelfinn and Eelfinn. 
They were allowed to ask any three questions, and receive three true
answers.  These answers were a great {x{waid to the Firsts in maintaining
Mayene's independence from Tear.  But this advantage was given away by a
young ruler who gave {x{waway the ter'angreal to the Tairens as a sign of good
will.  He had already used it, and so it was no longer of any use to him.  {x

{wDespite this loss, Mayene has remained independent for hundreds of years. 
This small city-state faces a constant challenge from the {x{wbulk of Tear to
the west, but the Mayeners are intent on remaining apart from the High Lords
of Tear.  {x

{WTar Valon{x

{wThe city of Tar Valon, nestled on an island in the River Erinin, is probably
the center of politics in the world.  Tar Valon is {x{windependent of any
nation, as it is the location of the White Tower.  The White Tower,
naturally, is the center of Aes Sedai {x{wauthority.  As such, it is certainly
the more important politically than any nation's capital.  {x

{wTar Valon is regarded as the premier work of the Ogier masons, though
Caemlyn is a close second.  Buildings flow organically from {x{wone to the next,
each building created to accent those around it.  The beauty of Tar Valon is
dominated by the White Tower {x{witself, rising high above the city.  {x

{wBeing the political center that it is, Tar Valon is also a wealthy city.  It
is filled with merchants and shops, catering to the {x{wwealthy citizens of this
richest of cities.  Despite the wealth evident in the city, crime is
unknown.  Those caught stealing {x{ware sent to the Tower where a sister has a
little talk with the thief; these thieves are seldom caught a second time. 
{x

{wWhile there are many who fear or even dislike the Aes Sedai who hold sway in
Tar Valon, none can deny the beauty of this city.  The {x{wOgier truly outdid
themselves in its construction, and any traveler would do well to make a
stop in Tar Valon.  {x

Market Lane~
Market Lane is a narrow thoroughfare that cuts between two neat rows of
shops.  The road looks fairly old and well used but shows signs of being
recently repaired.  The numerous colorful stalls placed outside of each of
the shops of this area make the road barely wide enough for a wagon to
traverse it safely.  Market Lane joins a much wider road a short distance
away to the north, known as North Street.

Caemlyn, this one has been paved with slabs of {Dg{wra{Dy{w {Ds{wton{De{x although they look
worn and {Dr{wu{Dtt{we{Dd{x from the many years of use that they have had.  The street
is overlooked along both sides by groups of small{D b{wr{yi{Dc{wk{x buildings, broken up
by narrow {Wl{wa{Wn{we{Ws{x and {Da{wl{Dl{we{Dy{ws{x; the majority of the buildings within this
vicinity appear to be shops.

North Street~
North Street curves sharply at this point as it leads through the
northern part of the New City.  Flanking both sides of the road are numerous
buildings constructed from{D b{wr{yi{Dc{wk{x and {yt{Di{ymb{De{yr{x, each one topped with a dull
tiled roof.  Most of the buildings within this area are houses although
there are also one or two shops nearby.

Caembarin Road~
Caembarin is a particularly long yet broad road that leads through the
eastern part of the New City.  The gray {Dp{wa{Dvi{wn{Dg{w {Ds{wl{Da{wb{Ds{x which cover the road's
surface look worn, {Dr{wu{Dtt{we{Dd{x and in need of some repairs.  Numerous brick
buildings have been constructed along each side of the road although the
majority of them appear to be houses.  In the distance to the west the
Ogier-built protective walls that surround the Inner City can be seen.

Bard's Lane Theater is little more than a large hall.  An attempt to make
the white plaster walls less drab has been made by a liberal dosage of
{Rc{Yo{Bl{Ro{Yr{Bf{Ru{Yl {Bb{Ru{Yn{Bt{Ri{Yn{Bg{x.  The hall's floor has been clad with {Dg{wra{Dy{w {Ds{wton{De{x tiles
although there are deep scratch marks in some places where heavy items have
been dragged around the room.  A pair of wide {ywooden doors{x on the south side

{BThe Thieftaker's Guild{x - {wA Plain Office{x~
There is little out of the ordinary about this office.  It is a plain
room that is roughly square in shape and whose walls have been left as white
plaster.  The floor is almost as bare as the walls, a square blue rug placed
at the center of the room over the gray stone tiles.  On the south side of
the room is a large window fitted with blue curtains, the window looks out
onto Caemlyn Road.  A door on the north side of the office appears to be the
room's only exit.

There is little out of the ordinary about this stable.  It is a small
structure built from red bricks.  The earthy floor is littered with straw
making the area very dusty.  The individual stalls are marked by sturdy

fixed to the wall outside their owner's respective stalls.  A wide set of
doors on the west side of the building lead out into a small yard.

belonging to the customers of a nearby inn.  The structure is clean, warm

stall.  There is also plenty of water and food available for horses; a hay
loft built over the stalls appears to be the place where the sacks of dry
feed and bales of hay and straw are kept.  The rear wall of the stable has
been used to store various tools such as rakes, hayforks and shovels on
sturdy wooden racks.

{gCaemlyn Park{x~
Caemlyn Park is one of the New City's larger public parks.  A narrow
gravel trail makes its way through the park around bushy undergrowth and
colorful {cf{Cl{Wo{Cw{cer{Cb{We{Cd{cs{x.  Dotted across the area are small groups of {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x with
low spreading branches that provide welcome shade during the sunny weather. 
The park is separated from the rest of Caemlyn by a ornamental wall that is
built from smoothed white stones; in the south wall is a large {Di{wro{Dn g{wat{De{x
that leads out into the streets of the New City.

{gCaemlyn Park{x~
Caemlyn Park's {Ds{wh{Dad{we{Dd w{wa{Dl{wk{Ds{x and beautiful {mf{Ml{Yow{Me{mr d{Mis{Ypl{May{ms{x make it one of
the city's top attractions.  The park is a big area of {gh{Gi{Yl{Gl{gy g{Gr{Ya{Gs{gs{Gl{Ya{Gn{gd{x that
is overlooked from all sides at a distance by towering buildings made of
stone and brick.  At this point in the park is a narrow {Dg{wr{ya{Dv{we{yl{D p{wa{yt{Dh{x that
closely follows the white stone {Wperimeter wall{x of the park, past towering
{gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x and flowering {gb{Gu{gsh{Ge{gs{x.

Ladoman Street Book Shop~
This is a tiny book shop built on Ladoman Street.  Despite its small
size, this shop is a treasure trove of books, from common prints to more
rare and exotic tomes.  The room is lit up by lanterns hung from the ceiling
although the windows on the west side of the room do provide some light
during the day.  The walls of the shop are almost entirely covered with rows
of shelves, each one housing scores of books.  At the eastern end of the
store is a small door that leads to the storeowner's quarters and at the
opposite side of the room is a door leading out onto the street.

Although this particular shop is small there seems to be plenty of room
for the shopkeeper to display their goods on {ys{Dh{yelv{De{ys{x attached to the walls. 
The room has been kept tidy; the light cast by the lanterns fixed to the
walls of the shop reveal no dust or debris upon the floor or hidden in the
corners of the room.  A large {yc{Do{yunt{De{yr{x sits on the south side of the room in
front of a {yw{Do{yod{De{yn s{Dt{yairca{Ds{ye{x that probably leads to the shopkeeper's
quarters.  The only other exit from this room is a door on the opposite side
of the room that leads out onto North Street.

horses belonging to the customers of a nearby inn.  The structure is clean,
warm and comfy for its equine residents and each horse is allocated its own
stall.  There is also plenty of food and water available for horses; a hay
loft built over the stalls appears to be the place where the sacks of dry
feed and bales of straw and hay are kept.

stains upon the white plaster walls.  The hallway's wooden floorboards have
been left bare apart from a narrow strip of {Dg{wra{Dy{x {Dc{wa{Drp{we{Dt{x placed upon them
which looks grimy and frayed.  At the center of the hallway is a spiraling
staircase made of sturdy oak which leads downwards to the ground floor of
the inn.  There are several doorways along this corridor leading into the
guest rooms.

at the end of the hallway that leads into the kitchen.

This square cellar is approximately fifteen paces across and has been
constructed from blocks of gray stone.  Thick timber beams aid in supporting
the structure and provide excellent places for the resident spiders to
anchor their webs.  The gray stone clad floor is littered with dust and
debris apart from a small area around the foot of a wooden staircase which
appears to have been recently swept clear.  The staircase leads upwards to
the only exit from this room, a wooden trapdoor set in the cellar's ceiling.

Despite the thoroughfare's name, Caemlyn Road is a wide boulevard that is
split down the middle by strips of {gg{Gr{ga{Gs{gs{x and {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x.  The majority of the
{Dg{wra{Dy{w {Ds{wton{De{x buildings that flank the boulevard are inns and shops but there
are also one or two large houses to be seen here.  Two thoroughfares
intersect Caemlyn Road at this point; Full Moon Street leads off to the

Caemlyn Road~
Although Caemlyn Road is one of the main thoroughfares of the city of
Caemlyn, the road is actually a boulevard that is split down the middle by
strips of {gt{Gr{ge{Ge{gs{x and {gg{Gr{ga{Gs{gs{x.  There are numerous tall {Dg{wra{Dy{w {Ds{wton{De{x buildings
overlooking the thoroughfare at this point but they all seem to pale into
insignificance when compared to the {Wwhite{x {Wstone{x structures built on the
distant {gh{Gi{Yl{Gl{gs{x towards the center of Caemlyn.

{WThe Sunrise Gate{x~
At this point along Caemlyn Road is the Sunrise Gate, the easternmost
entrance into the city of Caemlyn, Andor's capital.  The gate is a huge

constructed from {Ws{wi{Wlv{we{Wr{w-{Ws{wtr{Wea{wke{Wd{x stone.  On the east side of the gate
outside of the city walls is Low Caemlyn, a brickwork warren of houses,
markets and warehouses whilst on the opposite side of the gate within the
city walls is the New City.

street that meanders like a river as it follows the contours of the {gh{Gi{Yl{Gl{gs{x of
Caemlyn.  Despite what the name of this street suggests, there are no shops
along this road and certainly no candle makers.  What buildings there are
along this road appear to be inns and taverns as well as a few small
warehouses.  Chandler's Street is joined by a much more grandly constructed
road to the north called Caemlyn Road.

has been paved with {Dg{wra{Dy{w {Ds{wton{De{x slabs although they appear to be {Dp{wi{Dtt{we{Dd{x and
worn from the many years of use that they have had.  The street is bordered
along both sides by clusters of small brick buildings, split up by narrow
{Da{wl{Dl{we{Dy{ws{x and {Wl{wa{Wn{we{Ws{x; the majority of the structures within this vicinity are
houses.

{WThe Queen's Plaza{x~
The Queen's Plaza is a great paved courtyard that is square in shape and
ringed with tall columns, all made of pure white stone.  To the south of the
Queen's Plaza lies the Royal Palace, a huge Ogier-made building constructed
with white stone and consisting of many tall towers, pointed spires,
gold-covered domes and intricately carved balconies.  A tall white stone
wall that encircles the Palace's grounds lies north of the Queen's Plaza;
built into the wall are a set of tall gilded gates that look out onto the
Oval Plaza.

The Rear Entranceway~
This is the north end of a large yard located at the rear of the Royal
Palace.  It is a wide rectangular area that is paved with white stone with
two wide paths branching off from it; one path leads east whilst the other
leads west.  The rear entranceway into the Royal Palace is marked by a
simple white stone colonnade built along the northern border of the
courtyard.  Beyond the pillars lies a pair of iron strapped gates that lead
into the main building.

{WThe South Stable Gate{x~
The white stone wall that encloses the grounds of the Royal Palace is
broken at this point by a set of tall gilded gates known as the South Stable
Gate.  The gate leads into the grounds from one of the Inner City's curving
streets and is a much more secluded entranceway than the one in the Oval
Plaza.  The view from this gateway is almost as impressive; it gives a clear
line of sight of a tree filled park within the city and the rolling plains
and forests that lies beyond the tall silver-streaked walls that surround
all of Caemlyn.

during any time of the day or night.  It is a large area, paved with white
stone and flanked along its north and south sides by the rows of tall arched
doors of the stables, also constructed from white stone.  The buildings
alone would seem impressive but the huge towering structure of the Royal
Palace nearby seems to diminish that effect.  There are two wide paths, also
paved with white stone leading away from this stable yard from opposite
sides.

A Wide Path~
This is a wide path that has been paved with slabs of white stone.  Two
rows of red rose bushes have been planted along the sides of the path;
adding color to what would have been a bland walkway.  The great white stone
structure that sits to the north and towers over this path is the Royal
Palace, the official residence of the Queen of Andor; its tall spires and
golden domes are wonderful examples of the work achieved by the ancient
Ogier masons.

A Wide Hallway~
This is one of the many spacious hallways within the Royal Palace.  The

The Grand Hall~
Rows of white columns twenty paces high have been built down the sides of
the Grand Hall.  The light from the tall windows in the east and west walls
mingle with the colored light from the great windows set in the vaulted
ceiling, windows where the White Lion alternated with the portraits of the
early Queens of the realm and scenes of great Andoran victories.  A long
strip of red carpet has been placed down the center of hall's red and white
tiled floor, leading to a white marble dais at the southern end of the hall.

The prison cells in the Royal Palace are unusual in comparison with other
palaces as they are not placed within the basement levels of the building. 
Instead this simple square chamber is situated in one of the more secluded

side of the room gives a minute amount of light, just enough to reveal a
simple cot and an old wooden pail placed in one corner of the room.  The
only exit from this cell is a large iron-braced door on the south side of

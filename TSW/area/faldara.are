a Fal Daran patrolman~
A Fal Daran patrolman walks here, making his rounds.
~
This patrolman is just doing his duty, keeping a constant surveillance
from the top of the city walls.  His topknot is well-kept, and he carries
his spear as if he knows how to use it.  His weathered face shows some signs
of aging, but his muscles appear anything but flabby.

a watch sergeant~
A watch sergeant looks menacingly about, searching for someone to find guilty of anything.
~
This sergeant certainly looks meaner than any of the other watchmen.

A Fal Daran lookout scans the horizon, searching for anything out of the ordinary.

Because of the constant Shadowspawn threat, the position of lookout is

Quite obviously, this guard is incapacitated in a big way.  His snores
practically shake the nearby walls, and you are amazed that the noise he is
making hasn't already caused him to wake himself.

A pitch black raven is perched here, staring at you with unblinking eyes.
~
A large, pitch black raven is sitting very still as it surveys the
surroundings here.  Although you know birds to be less than intelligent, you
somehow know that the bird is watching you specifically and that it isn't
afraid of you at all.  In fact, you feel like it hates you passionately,
although, it's just a bird, isn't it?

Instantly you recognize this Shienaran from his well-shaved head save a
single top-knot.  His muscles flex and relax as he moves around, and if

A borderland warrior walks quickly by you, ignoring your presence completely.

While they are not known for their politeness, some courtesy should be
expected.  This borderlander doesn't seem to bother with even the slightest
hint of manners.  In fact, he appears to be offended by your very existence.

Sweating profusely, a warrior in training stops to rest for a while.
~
Who would believe one person could sweat so much???  This warrior seems
proficient enough at his work, but it is amazing that his weapon doesn't fly
out of his hands because of all the sweat.  Too bad he forgot his towel...

This practice dummy looks like a common field soldier who is wielding a
shield and sword.  It seems to have taken quite a bit of abuse, but still
resembles a human enough for the borderguard not to retire it or take it
down for kindling.

wooden lance is lowered slightly as if he were charging.  You notice that
while it is mounted, it only a few scratches are on the practice horse part.
Of course, the guard would train warriors to hit the rider.

Without hesitation you are able to recall all of the childhood memories
you have of stories about trollocs.  This practice dummy, while made of wood
and canvas, gives you a much better idea what a trolloc must look like,
since it is much larger than man size.

you will get from the borderguard once you sign up, and even promises money
and untold riches, assuming you do your part.

one the luxury of being sedentary in an office all day.  This sergeant's
hands are hard and callused from many hours training and, from the scars on
his face, fighting.

A brown horse is here, standing complacently.
~
A brown-haired horse is here, standing complacently and not doing much of
anything.  In fact, if its eyes weren't open, you would be sure that it was
sleeping on its feet.  Even so, you still think the odds of it being asleep
at this moment are at least slim.

a butcher~
A large, hairy man wearing a bloody apron is here, holding a cleaver loosely in one hand.
~
Until now, it had seemed that wars and battles were gruesome, but after
seeing this man, you know better.  Entrails and blood are splattered on
nearly every portion of his body, and his protective apron is a deep purple.
At one time it may have been white, but that time is long past...

A blacksmith is here, putting away his tools as he steps away from the forge.
~
Bulging biceps are the first thing you notice about this man.  His
leather protection apron only covers the shoulders, and when he is working,
it is hot enough so he chooses not to have the additional heat from wearing
a shirt.  Methodically, he swings the hammer to pound the metal into shape.

If you didn't know any better, you would believe that this weaver was
once a tinker, or at least was descended from one.  Bright stripes of
orange, green, red and blue decorate the short and pants that she wears, and
you have no doubt that she would be quite easy to find in a crowd.

Outside the South Gate~
Before you are the large, foreboding walls of this borderland town.  While
no moat surrounds the city, you catch glimpses of guards at various points
along the twenty feet tall walls and the thick, iron-bound gates look like
they could be closed at a moment's notice.

As you pass the portcullis, the large iron-bound gates loom over you on
either side.  Above you, you are shaded from the sun by yet another gate,
one that appears to reinforce the main gates and that can be dropped in an
instant.  The streets of Fal Dara open up before you, and you notice small
staircases leading up to the ramparts along the city walls to either side of
you.

building which appears to be an inn of some sort.  You also hear the sounds
of horses, so it is safe to assume they can provide lodging for those as
well.  To the north, much of the city traffic is continuing on to enter the
market center, where anything and everything is traded.

notice that the wide doors are well-kept and the off-white paint on the
building makes it appear almost new.  On your south side, the city wall
looms over your, providing shade from the sun to those who stand close to
it, and protection for those staying on this side of them.

mounted on a horse, but only if they were will to ride very low on its back.
On your south side, the city wall looms over your, providing shade from the

all having their area border against the city walls.  On your south side,

As you enter this south end of the trader's market, the hustle and bustle
of market life completely envelops you.  Farmers and tradesman here compete
with each other, seeing who can offer the finest fruits and vegetables for
the lowest price.  Other street hawkers are selling food and refreshment for
the weary shoppers.  You even spot a tinker who has a small little booth and
is offering to mend anything that might require it.  To the west, the
commercial district of Fal Dara is laid out with all of the more permanent
shops.

West End of Trader's Market~
Street hawkers and others fill this part of the market with a background
noise that makes it difficult for you to have your own thoughts.  Many
traders have brought their exotic spices and scents here to sell, hoping to
tempt the more well-to-do market goers, as the rent for the west market is
much higher do to its proximity to the community park and the keep itself.

going on all around you.  Merchants in their wagons, showing their wares,
and passer-bys looking as they search for just the right piece.  To the
north, there appears to be a break in the crowd, which might provide you the
opportunity for some needed rest...

You can immediately tell that you have entered the market district just
by the general volume of passer-bys and the increased volume of traffic. 
Farmers pulling produce in handcarts scurry about and street vendors yell at
anyone who even slows for a second to try and hawk their wares.  It is
difficult not to get caught up in the throng as it moves westwards towards
the center of the marketplace.

Market Road~

storefront has a large sign with a horse on it, and the doors appear large
enough for a person to potentially enter while mounted, as long as they went
slow and kept their head close to the horse.

Market Road~
This street follows an east-west course and is paved with large
cobblestones.  To the north you see a number of person residencies, and the
south offers an excellent view of the stable yards where combat-ready mounts
and others are let loose to exercise.  You can just barely make out the
sounds of the market that lies in the middle of the town to your west.

Community Park~
A surprisingly peaceful feeling permeates this park.  The well cared-for
plants are healthy, and you even see some flowers in bloom.  All around
there is the chirping of birds, but, not a single crow or raven is in sight.
There is a beautiful fountain in the middle of the park with honorary
statues gracing the center of it to remember heroes long forgotten.

Inside the Watch Tower~
As you ascend the tower, little light is allowed to pass through the
small arrow holes against the wall of the tower.  At even intervals, a
basket of arrows is full, waiting to be used in case of assault or
emergency.  Frequent changes of the guard allow watchmen in the tower to
remain alert and attentive during their shifts.

Atop the Southwest Watch Tower~
This tower by far offers the most incredible view from the city.  Below
you are the lowlands of Shienar, and a sunset from here is nothing less than
dazzling.  The south gates to the city boast much of the traffic from
inland, and up here, it seems like you haven't a care in the world.

Atop the Northwest Watch Tower~
This tower grants you an excellent view of, well, nothing.  Immediately
southwest of you is the keep which towers over your head, and immediately
north and west of you are the Mountains of Dhoom.  If you are lucky, maybe
you'll spot a lone raven to take a pot shot at, or perhaps even a mountain
goat, although, even those are scarce on mountains as steep as these.

Atop the Northeast Watch Tower~
Of all the towers in the city, this one has the most important role.  It
is here that the watch must sound the alarm for any activity coming out of
Tarwin's Gap.  While there are watchmen in the gap, there are never enough
precautions to take when dealing with the shadow.  This tower is almost high
enough to see into the gap itself, but none but the most eagle-eyed would be
able to do so.

Atop the Southeast Watch Tower~
From here, one has an easy way of monitoring both gates that allow
traffic into the city.  To the north, the east gate sees mostly farmers and
traders avoiding the high volume of traffic using the south gate.  The south
gate offers the most direct route into the city, and is generally used by
everyone who doesn't know about the other gate.

The General Store~
The general store is the best place to acquire all of the goods you think
you might need or aren't sure you have.  Behind the counter, you can see
camping equipment, travel goods, foodstuffs that store for long periods, and
lamps and oil.  Of greatest interest is the barrel of fresh apples next to
the counter, since fresh fruit is always so hard to come by in the city.

Vibrant cloths are neatly stacked in the corner of this shop, and there
are two models displaying clothing that Faelicia has made in the past.  The
counter of the shop is covered in lines evenly marked running the length of
the counter itself, probably useful in measuring and cutting the cloth as is
needed for making clothes.

This seems to be quite the place to be.  A few serving girls pass through
the crowd, constantly circulating and getting many stares and whistles from
those in attendance.  Savory smells waft in from the kitchen where stew and
mutton are being prepared, and conversation ebbs and flows throughout the
room.  A small stand near the bar allows a place for local talent or gleemen
to perform, however, none are in attendance at this time.

The Butcher's Block~
It is almost awe-inspiring to see this many different kinds of meats in
one room.  Fresh meats that you recognize include lamb, goat, cow, horse,
rabbit and a few others that you aren't quite sure of.  Smoked meats all
tend to look about the same, but they have an assortment of those as well. 
The shopkeeper, a large, round man, carries a butcher's knife recently
cleaned on his apron and appears busy preparing his latest slaughter.

Intersection of Butcher Block Road and the Road to the Keep~
As you stand here in the road, observing, you detect a distinctly strong
smell of a slaughterhouse.  It is almost sickly sweet and brings thoughts of
campfires and retching in the same breath.  To the north, you see the
continuation of Keep Road, which, as its name states, leads to the keep.

recently slaughtered, but that might just be your imagination.

boisterous laughter.  You have seen more than one off-duty watchmen enter
there, so perhaps that means something.

The Armory - Tough Enough for even You!~
The armory is the epitome of order.  Metalworking tools are hung neatly
along the north wall, and the armorer has two anvils located in the back
along with a large firepit located on the east wall.  It appears that the
pit is shared with the weaponsmith next door, but the armorer has his own
fuel for the pit in order to keep it at the temperature he desires.

useable weapons on display.  A small anvil is located in the back along with
a large firepit located on the west wall.  It appears that the pit is shared

practically shines it is kept so clean and well-oiled.  Various pictures and
tapestries are hung tastefully on the wall, and there is an open hallway
leading north into the common room where one might have a touch of mean with
something to eat.

Dried fruits of all types are arranged in boxes and barrels along the floor,
and you even spot a few canisters of spices that help make meat and other
foodstuffs palatable.

Stout wooden beams support the ceiling and the floor above, but have been
carved so as to seem more decorational than functional.  A doorway to the
east allows serving girls to enter and return from the kitchen, bearing
their treasures.

fireplace occupy the attention of all those employed here.  A spit across
the fireplace is being turned by one of the assistant cooks in order to keep
the lamb cooking evenly.  One of the ovens seems to be used for baking
bread, while the other appears to have a dessert of some kind.  If only you
could have a taste of whatever that wonderful smell is!

being here except for the occasional scratch from a horseshoe as it is led
outside to the stable yard.

It seems rather odd that so much space would be dedicated to the horses,
but that seems to be the only purpose of this field.  Picket-lines mark the
spots where military horses are tethered after making their rounds, and
other, private-owned horses are also allowed to exercise here should their
masters desire it.

easily accommodate eight to ten peasants, or one lady, whichever happen to
be using it at the time.

A Small, Wooded Grove~
The close proximity of the practice yards is muted very efficiently by
the thick grove of trees.  The shade offers a needed respite from the hot
sun and invites you to rest a while and take a load off of your shoulders. 
You see not a few of the recruits taking breaks from their training here
since it has a quiet and peace not found in the bunkroom.

The practice yards seem to be the location of the most practice and
activity with the guard.  You are able to see three different instructors
here teaching the recruits the proper techniques of one-to-one combat.  One
is showing them how to use their spears and their pikes, another how to
fight in closed-quarters with daggers or short swords, and the third is
demonstrating what to do in combat situations.

The archery range gives an overzealous recruit the means to get rid of
some of their more destructive energy.  With all of the targets at the east
end of the field, some rather close to the east wall, you notice that the
east wall has an additional barrier between the walkway and the archery
field that isn't present anywhere else.  You surmise this is do to some of
the less-accurate misfires from those who were practicing here.

perhaps you should do the same.

As with all practice areas, there are constantly men at practice here.

horseback, on foot, or any way one might want to practice or compete.

Entry to the Barracks~
The barracks are bustling with activity.  You hear sounds of laughter and
rough-housing coming from the bunkroom to the north.  Standard issue comes
from the west, and you here a berating yelling from an officer to the east.

Campaign Staging Area~
Row upon row of benches face the east of the room, where a writing tablet
is hung on the wall.  A small podium in front of the tablet offers a place
for an officer to communicate any message or important communication in a
quick an efficient fashion.  The Shienaran herald is hung ostentatiously on
the south wall...reminding all who they are serving.

Staircase to the North Wall~
This staircase is by far the largest access to the defensive wall
surrounding the city.  It has a ramp up the middle of it to it to permit
access to siege engines, and the staircase itself is at least thirty feet
wide.  Empty weapon racks are located at the bottom of either side of the
staircase, allowing quick arming of the defenders of the city should the
need ever arise.

The Bunkroom~
Line upon line of wooden bunks are set three high where ever they will
fit within this room.  Between each set of bunks is a set of lockers where
the recruits are able to store their personal affects.  A small clearing is
visible in the middle of the room, allowing for dicing games and after-hours
activity by the recruits.

The Sergeant's Office~
The sergeant's office is clutter-free and offers little in way of
comfort.  A plain, wooden desk is placed facing the door, and a single
back-less chair is in front of it.  Sitting on the desk is a loaded crossbow
that is cocked and ready.  Behind the desk, a topical map of Tarwin's Gap is
hung on the wall.

Outside the Keep Gate~
By far the largest and tallest structure of this town, the keep looms
over you majesticaly.  Its front doors are engraved beautifully with the
scenes of battles fought and won, but also appear useful if the need were to
arrise for defenders to once again enter and bar them against coming foes. 
Thin windows appear to be brilliant as their glass reflect the sun, but you
can't help but notice that they all seem to be pointed here, and would
provide an excellent shot...

Well-Kept Floral Gardens~
These gardens border on the community park, and provide a place of quiet
meditation to the habitants of the keep.  The flowers here reflect the
loving touch of the gardener and are healthy and blooming.  An even nicer
touch is the grass that is lush and green to either side of the small
walking paths.

and chairs are quite soft and beg for relaxation.  The checkerboard floor,
continued from the entryway, is warmed by a cheery fire in the fireplace at
the north end of the room.

A Marble-Floored Foyer~
The difference between this entryway and the facade of the keep is
tremendous.  You eyes are drawn to take in the magnificent black and white
marble flooring that checkerboards across the room.  A glistening white
marble staircase is covered by a thick red carpet and leads to the upper
level.  The chandelier appears to be made of fine brass and has places for
twenty-four candles, which surely would make this room gleam like at
mid-day.

The Great Hall~
The walls of this enormous hall are decorated with the stuffed heads of
animals taken in the hunt as well as instruments of war arrayed in
ceremonial fashion.  An enormous wooden table goes along the middle of the
hall and has chairs around it that would easily seat forty people.  Despite
its splendor, you also notice that there are pieces of furniture below each
of the windows, making them readily defensible should the need arise.

This room is clean and simply furnished.  A number of beds line the south
wall, hoping to take advantage of the heat from the fireplace just behind
it.  Each bed has a trunk in front of it which contains the personal affects
of the servants.  While it is not as lavish as the rest of the keep, the
servants are certainly not doing too poorly...

While this room isn't decked out with finery, you have no trouble
recognizing that it belongs to a Lord.  The magnificent foyer floor
continues its pattern, and three white marble pillars are spaced evenly on
each side of the room to support the ceiling.  A small raised dais lies at
the front of the room where two well-crafted thrones sit side-by-side.  You
can just imagine a trumpet fanfare announcing the arrival of some far-off
nobleman...

The kitchen is the lifeblood of the keep, and its activity is seen going
constantly.  There are two large fireplaces where all of the cooking is
done, and one boasts a large metal kettle that is kept boiling night and
day, always guaranteeing a hot meal for a famished guardsman.  Various
cooking utensils, pots and pans are scattered about, all within easy reach
of the cooks on duty.

Secret Throne Chamber~
If you weren't already in here, you'd never believe that this room
existed.  The door to the throne room is so well concealed that even now you
are having difficulty seeing where you entered from.  The rough-hewn stone
helps to diminish the light it reflects, and you can see a small hole in the
floor which you think you might be able to wiggle through.

The Keep's Larder~
The keep larder is nothing more than a glorified pantry...and much
glorified it is!  Shelves decorate every wall and are loaded with an
assortment of barrels, bags, dried fruits and spices.  Just about everything
you could think to eat and some things you don't even recognize.  Given the
size of the larder and the food it contains, it would appear that it could
sustain a fairly long siege, if required.

bunched up towards the west end the wall, as if to hide something.  A foul
stench is present throughout and reminds you of something long dead and
rotting.

clamps built into it for both the arms and the legs.  It is safe to assume
this is where the true interrogation takes place, since there are tell-tale

This small room is anything but comfortable.  Its walls are moist from

the west door has bars over a small window cut in the center of it.  A small
chair sits next to the door, providing little comfort to the guard who is
stationed in it.

This tunnel seems to stretch forever as it twists and turns.  Often, the
ceiling overhead is riddled with holes and darkness that your light won't
even reach.  As you travel along the tunnel, you reach a point where the
space between the ceiling and floor grows so small you have to crawl through
it, but it seems that there is a light at the end of it

As you enter the cellar, a cool air envelops you and you catch a whiff 
of the moist soil smell that permeates the cellar.  While there are casks of
the cheaper wine lined upon the east and south wall, both the north and west
walls hold bottles of very fine Andoran red.  Dust covers most of those
bottles, as they are saved for very special occasions...

this hall beautiful but utilitarian as well.

doors leading from this room.

southeast corner of the room looks to boast running water, a luxury that
many kings to not enjoy.

genuine sung wood!  While the room isn't lavish, fine linens grace the bed
and heavy drapes cover the windows along the north wall.  An armor stand is
placed in the southwest corner of the room for those infrequent times that
the Lord can remove his armor for rest.

that you have been in.  Row upon row of outfits are hung along each of the
walls here.  The only visible breaks in the clothing occur where the two
doors lead to the Lord and Lady's personal bedchambers.  Though not
surprising, it is interesting to note that many of the outfits include some
sort of protective armor.

Somehow, you find yourself standing on top of the armory.  You see a
trapdoor in the roof where you could drop down into the armory itself.  As
you look to the north, you see the north wall, and while this roof isn't
connected to the wall, you think that you probably can jump across the space
and make it to the wall without too much difficulty.

From these ramparts, you have a view that even the Creator would envy. 
Tarwin's Gap unfolds to the northeast.  South lies the flat plains of
Shienar, and the towering peaks of the Mountains of Dhoom watch over the
city to the north and the west.  Closer to home, you can watch the
activities of the guardsmen in the training grounds or even view the
tradesmen in the market center.  It almost feels as if everything is under

A Waygate in the Rolling Hills~
The country around the Waygate is rolling, forested hills, but aside from
the gates themselves there is no sign of any Ogier grove.  Most of the trees
are gray skeletons clawing at the sky.  Fewer evergreens than most are used
to dot the forest, and of them, dead, brown needles and leaves cover many.

A Small Bedroom~
This simple bedroom has everything a weary traveler could desire.  A
small wash basin in the corner to refresh and clean of the dust from the
road is in the corner.  Opposite the door is a bed which looks like it is
well used, but still comfortable.  A small fireplace has a stack of firewood
next to it and offers both light and heat to keep the room comfortable.

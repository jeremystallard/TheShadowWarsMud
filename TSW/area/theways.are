Lord he serves.  Black hair, lacking all hint of human gloss or texture,
covers only his head, leaving his pale face bare.  Perhaps the most chilling
difference between humans and this half-man is in his face, so like a human

sound beneath your feet, as if bits of stone flake off at every step. 
Everything you can see is covered with shallow holes, some tiny pin pricks,
others shallow, rough-edged craters a stride across, as if there has been a
rain of acid, or the stone is rotting.  The guard rail shows cracks and
holes too.  In places it is gone altogether for as much as a span.  For all
you know, the bridge could be a solid stone all the way to the center of the
earth, but what you see makes you hope that it will stand long enough for
you to reach the other end.  {x

{DThe Ways seem almost boring because you have been walking and searching
for hours.  The silence is only broken from time to time by a startling,
soft wind -- maybe the dreaded Machin Shin.  Presently worse, however, is
that you are standing in the middle of a bridge, and only a few feet ahead
of you, it ends in a jagged gap.  The light of your lantern stretches just
far enough to touch the other side, thrusting out of the dark like a giant's
broken tooth.  A loose stone bounces across the ground into the dead black
below.  If there is any sound of it striking bottom, you do not hear it. 
You must turn back.  {x

{DOgier Elders would not be pleased to find you here.  They have banned
everyone from traveling the Ways, for the darkness, and the creature that
roams them have made them deadly.  Few, like you, have dared to travel the
Ways and can relate that the organic stone, once beautiful and smooth, is
now pitted and broken, sometimes to the point of crumbling when you touch
it.  The trees and grass that once graced the islands are long gone, and the
darkness is thick, deeper than night, and resistant to all light brought
against it.  Rumor has it that the Ways were grown from the One Power by
male Aes Sedai, and therefore, with Saidin.  The deterioration that you see
is almost certainly a result of the taint from Saidin seeping into that
which was made from it.  {x

followed.  For the first time, your light allows you a view of the

If there is a bottom, it could be a thousand feet down.  Or never.  At a
bridge to the left, because it is so close, you can see what is under the
bridge, holding it up.  Nothing.  Less than a span in thickness, and
absolutely nothing underneath.  You divert your eyes to another bridge, and
another.  There is a Waygate at the end of them, somewhere, a gate back to
the world, where there is sun and sky and wind.  {x

over another with no apparent means of support.  Directions such as north or
south, up or down, have no real meaning in the Ways, and paths often spiral
above or below for no obvious reason.  A day's walk may bring you to a

{DCrossing a bridge, you wonder what holds it up.  Your boots make a gritty
sound beneath your feet, as if bits of stone flake off at every step. 
Everything you can see is covered with shallow holes, some tiny pin pricks,
others shallow, rough-edged craters a stride across, as if there has been a
rain of acid, or the stone is rotting.  The guard rail shows cracks and
holes too.  In places it is gone altogether for as much as a span.  For all
you know, the bridge could be a solid stone all the way to the center of the
earth, but what you see makes you hope that it will stand long enough for
you to reach the other end.  {x

themselves were once lushly planted with carpets of thick, green grass and a
variety of fruit trees.  Ranging in size from fifty to well over one hundred

perfectly round circles.  Each verdant isle had railings grown around the
perimeter, perhaps to keep the wary traveler from accidently falling over
the side.  This island is only a reminant of what it once was, covered in

{DCrossing a bridge, you wonder what holds it up.  Your boots make a gritty
sound beneath your feet, as if bits of stone flake off at every step. 
Everything you can see is covered with shallow holes, some tiny pin pricks,
others shallow, rough-edged craters a stride across, as if there has been a
rain of acid, or the stone is rotting.  The guard rail shows cracks and
holes too.  In places it is gone altogether for as much as a span.  For all
you know, the bridge could be a solid stone all the way to the center of the
earth, but what you see makes you hope that it will stand long enough for
you to reach the other end.  {x

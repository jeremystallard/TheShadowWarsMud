This unpaved side street bends sharply at this point as it twists its way
through {DB{yaerlo{Dn{x.  Although there are many {Dw{war{Wehou{wse{Ds{x built alongside this

Tall frame {Ds{wh{Wo{wp{Ds{x, {yi{wnn{ys{x and {Dh{yo{wus{ye{Ds{x border Arinelle Road as it leads through
{DB{yaerlo{Dn{x.  This is the northern end of the busy thoroughfare that has been
paved with gray square slabs of stone.  At the very end of the road is a
tall frame house which is much bigger than the rest of the abodes in the
{Dt{yow{Dn{x.  A second road leads off to the west although this one is much
narrower and has been left unpaved.

area but the only entrance from this point is a door leading into the
kitchen.  A strong smell of horses is coming from the huge stable with broad
arched doors on the west side of the yard.  The third building is a large
yet squat structure with tall {Dc{whi{Dmn{wey{Ds{w {xon the east side of the yard and
appears to be a blacksmith's workshop.

etched into the earth by the track of wagons leads along the southern edge
of a forest and up the gentle hillside towards the bridge.  The ground on
the southern side of the old road drops into a steep slope that is almost
vertical like a cliff.  A few {gt{Gree{gs{x have taken root on the precarious
incline but the majority of the sparsely growing vegetation appears to be
clumps of coarse {gg{Gras{gs{x and {gw{Geed{gs{x.

{yA Wooden Bridge{x~
A wide muddy {cs{Ct{Wre{Ca{cm{x running in a southerly direction splits the muddy
wagon track into two; the path is connected by a rickety wooden {ybridge{x.  The
road is dusty and deep grooves etched into its surface indicate that this
route is well used by wagons with extremely heavy loads.  The stream seems
to be shallow enough to cross by foot or by horseback alone, but the
construction of the {ybridge{x appears to indicate that there may be problems
for carts and wagons attempting a similar crossing without aid.  To the
north of the thoroughfare is densely growing deciduous woodland, the faint
sounds of tree felling that can be heard within the woods.  The ground on
the southern side of the old road suddenly drops into a steep slope; the
woodland becoming gradually less dense towards the bottom of the slope.

{yA Long Winding Road{x~
The densely packed woodland slopes gently downhill to the east and is
bisected east/west by a badly worn {ymuddy track{x, heavily scored and pitted
with what appears to be wagon or cart tracks.  The terrain here in this
forested area although visibly fertile seems to be very rocky, but the large
rock deposits do not appear to have been deposited here by natural means. 
Scattered along the edges of the roadside and even lurking within the wooded
area there are large piles of {Db{wr{Wok{we{Dn r{wo{Wc{wk{Ds{x; the sharp stone fragments look
as if to have been dumped there.

{yA Long Winding Road{x~
This is a long winding track, wide enough to all two large carts to
travel side by side as emphasized by the deep grooves in the road; the wear
and tear probably from heavy goods wagons or something of a similar nature. 
There appears to have been some rough maintenance to the road; a few {yd{Dea{yd
t{Dre{ye b{Dranche{ys{x pushed to the side and a few obvious patches where large
{Dpotholes{x in the road have been filled in with gravel and dirt.  The gently
sloping road is overlooked by tall deciduous {gt{Gree{gs{x and dense vegetation,
growing on both the northern and southern sides of the road; the gaps
between the tangled mess of {gt{Gree{gs{x and vegetation to the north reveal a {ylog
cabin{x although there appears to be no obvious way of reaching the building
from this point.

The Entrance To The Mine~
A first glance may suggest that this area is a simple openwork mine, the
entrance marked by a hefty wooden {ygate{x.  The overall area itself is very
reminiscent of a quarry save for the elongated shape of the excavation site.
Several {ylog cabins{x have been built within the area's wooden {yfence{x
boundaries, all of which are situated at a considerable distance away from
the main excavation site that is to the north.  To the south is a
particularly run down wooden {yshack{x which appears to be used as some sort of
guardhouse or watch post.  A long winding road leads downhill from here
towards the east through densely populated woodland.

{yA Wooden Shack{x~
A small rundown wooden {yshack{x has been constructed on the outskirts of a
small mining complex.  The building is roughly six feet square and eight
feet in and made mainly appears to be in need of some repairs to the walls
where some of the wood has rotted away.  The roof has been tiled in roughly
cut {Ds{cl{Da{ct{De{x yet a few gaps between the tiles clearly indicate that this
building is far from weatherproof.  A square window on the northern side of
the room overlooks the {ydirt track{x that leads away eastwards from the
entrance to the mines.  The only exit from this place appears to be a door
to the west.

The Mine~
The muddy area around here is level yet rocky in some places; its western
and northern boundaries have been clearly marked by a sheer cliff
approximately twenty five feet high.  The near-vertical slope is comprised
of dark {Dr{wo{Dc{wk{x that shows signs of being excavated.  There are large rocks
littering the ground, making it near impossible for a wagon to but there are
hoof prints in the dirt that suggest that either horses or mules are in use
at this site.  To the south a very large {ylog cabin{x with a gently sloping
roof has been constructed; although there appears to be a sturdy {Di{wro{Dn-b{wrace{Dd{x
door, the building has no windows.

{yA Log Cabin{x~
This is a particularly large {ylog cabin{x that is being used as a
storehouse.  It is about ten foot from floor to rafters and twenty to twenty
five feet square in size.  There are wooden rafters above but beyond those
the cabin seems to be at least another five foot in height to the point
where the inverse "v" shaped roof peaks.  The building itself is windowless;
apart from a few small gaps between the logs that make up the walls the only
source of light from the exterior of the building appears to be the
{Di{wro{Dn-b{wrace{Dd{x door on the northern side of the storage building.  The
storeroom is dusty and dry old place and is full of what appears to be sacks
of rock, probably ore waiting to be processed as well as its own fair share
of {Wc{wo{Wbwe{wb{Ws{x.

Towering Rocks~
Standing here is a dark gray cliff approximately fifteen feet in height. 
It stretches around from west to north in a gentle elongated arc, increasing
with height as it goes.  The cliff abruptly comes to an end at this point,
it is almost like something has pushed the earth from underground to form
the cliff; the result of an earthquake long ago or maybe even the Breaking
of the World.  The surface of the fault reveals the truly bewildering
structure of the rock that forms the cliff.  The remainder of the rock that
the cliff is comprised of is mostly likely buried deep within the ground,
under earth, gravel rocks and even small boulders that has been deposited
upon it over the years.  A faint sound of running water can be heard to the
west but the source of the sound is hidden from view by rocky debris that
lies at the base of the fault.

A Narrow Dirt Track~
A rough {ydirt track{x lies here and winds its way around the southern side
of the mining complex.  The path is strewn with large rocks and appears to
be far too narrow for a cart to traverse it although hoof prints dug deep
into the soft muddy ground show that horses or mules have been used around
this area.  To the east a large {ylog cabin{x has been constructed yet there are
no visible entrances into the building from this point.  A narrow shallow
{cs{Ct{Wre{Ca{cm{x runs parallel to the muddy path; its source is hidden amongst a
strange clutter of rocks and boulders that lie against a rocky incline a
short distance away to the northwest.  The western of the stream is
overlooked by tall {gt{Gree{gs{x and densely packed vegetation that seems to grow in
abundance around the base of the rocky slope which in turn is overlooked by
dark twisted mountainous peaks veiled by strange mists.

{CBeside A Stream{x~
Here lies a roughly oblong shaped area of rocky ground somewhere on the
southern side of the mine.  A rough {ydirt track{x winds its northwards back
to the main mining complex.  Overlooking this patch of ground to the east
is a small {ywooden shack{x that appears to be used as a guardhouse.  Beside
the shack are tools for the breaking down of rock into small fragments,
including hammers, anvils and a strange hand-driven contraption that looks
very much like a miniature mill used for grinding.  Also here are three
sets of wooden {ywash tables{x; obviously whatever is mined in this area is
finally extracted at this point.  A small shallow {cs{Ct{Wre{Ca{cm{x runs parallel to
the west of the path is probably the source of {cw{Ca{Wt{Ce{cr{x for the washing
tables used to extract the small deposits of gold from the waste
materials.

A Rocky Incline~
Near to the bottom of this tall dark gray stone cliff are signs of recent
digging; rubble and even a few broken remnants of mining tools have been
left here.  Foot and hoof prints dug deep into the muddy ground are clear
indications of recent traffic.  The cliff is approximately fifteen to twenty
feet in height and stretches around from west to north in a gentle elongated
arc, increasing with height as it goes.  What lies directly beyond the is
not visible from this point apart from a few forlorn-looking {gp{Glant{gs{x growing
in patches of earth near the edge, but beyond that a grand rocky outcrop can
be seen but there is not visible way to reach it.

A Rocky Incline~
This is the base of a steep mostly dark gray rocky incline that stretches
around in a gentle elongated arc.  The formation of the rock structure
however is very unusual in this area.  The layers of rock form a strange
series of anticlines and synclines creating a ripple-like effect with.  The
unusual structure may be due to the major land upheaval during the Breaking
of the World.  There are signs of digging activity here with debris littered
around the base of the slope, as well as tell-tale signs of excavation on
specific bands of rock here.

The Mine~
This is a large yet level rocky area whose west and northern boundaries
have been clearly marked by a sheer cliff of dark {Dr{wo{Dc{wk{x that does not appear
to be naturally made; any smooth signs of erosion have been erased near the
base of the cliff by the tell-tale signs of digging.  Large rocks litter the
ground, making it very difficult for a wagon to traverse with any ease.  To
the east a large {ylog cabin{x has been constructed; although there appears to
be a sturdy {Di{wro{Dn-b{wrace{Dd{x door, strangely the building has no windows, or at
least no windows visible from this point.  A hefty wooden {ygate{x lies due
south to where a well used {ydirt track{x is situated.

{yA Log Cabin{x~
This is a particularly large {ylog cabin{x, approximately ten foot from
floor to rafters and twenty feet square in size.  Thick cobwebs drape down
from the wooden rafters above but beyond those the building seems to be at
least another five foot in height to the point where the inverse "v" shaped
roof peaks.  The cabin is large considering its sole purpose is as a tool
shed.  There are no windows, apart from a few tiny gaps between the logs
that make up the walls; the only source of light from the exterior of the
building would be the on the western side of the cabin where an {Di{wro{Dn-b{wrace{Dd{x
door that marks the entranceway into the building if it were to be left
open.  There are several well fixed wooden racks upon the walls housing
various mining implements, ranging from {Dha{wmme{Drs{x to {Dp{wi{Wc{wk{Ds{x and {Dsh{wove{Wls{x.  An
incredible amount of dust from outside has settled upon the floor and the
items stored here in the cabin, finger prints within the dust reveal that
the building has had recent visitors.

A Rocky Incline~
A strange dark gray cliff approximately twenty to twenty five feet in
height stretches around from west to north in a gentle elongated arc. 
Although it is impossible to see what lies immediately beyond the top of the
cliff from this point, dark mountainous peaks shrouded in eerie white mists
can be seen towards the western horizon.  There are signs of digging
activity here with debris littered around the base as well as large pits in
the surface of the rocky slope.  At this point a large {cp{Co{Wo{Cl{x of {cw{Ca{Wt{Ce{cr{x has
formed upon the ground here; a series of tiny cracks in the surface of the
rock reveals a small {cs{Cp{Wri{Cn{cg{x to be the major source of the accumulating water
and also an indication that this area may be unstable.

A Rocky Incline~
This is the base of a steep gray rocky slope which it appears that recent
digging has revealed part of the rock's structure has a sort of wave-like
effect.  The top of the slope is approximately twenty or twenty five feet in
height; what lies beyond that is not visible from this point save for a few
forlorn-looking plants growing in patches of earth near the edge.  Although
there are a few piles of broken up rock that have been stacked up in this
area, this part of the excavation also appears to have been abandoned;
massive fractures in the rock suggest that this area may be unstable.

A Rocky Incline~
This is the bottom of a very steep rocky incline that stretches around
in an elongated curve from the west and around to the north.  There are
definite signs of digging activity here with debris littered around the base
as well as large angular pits dig into what was once smooth rock; there are
still some places upon the rock's surface where the effects of erosion have
not been erased by excavation.  The general area seems more dry and dustier
than it really is, probably due to the recent excavation of rock at this
site.

An almost vertical dark stone slope approximately twenty feet in height
towers forms the northern boundary of this area of rocky ground.  There are
many signs of digging activity here; the debris littered around the base and
even a few mining tools left propped up against the slope.  A large {ylog
cabin{x has been constructed a fair distance away to the south; from here
there appears to be no visible entranceways into the building.  And in the
distance to the southeast is a vast expanse of woodland can be seen over a
tall wooden {yfence{x that forms the southern boundary of this area.

southern and eastern perimeter of this area beyond which densely populated
woodland towers over the comparatively miniscule fencing.  A large {ylog{x {ycabin{x
has been built directly to the south but there appears not be no door or
windows at this side of the building in which to gain entry.

ahead has been blocked by a tall rickety wooden {yfence{x along the eastern and

of the room overlooks a small {cs{Ct{Wre{Ca{cm{x as well as small rocky area scattered
with various items of mining equipment.  At the center of the {yhut{x a large
wooden {ycrate{x has been placed plus two smaller and equally rickety looking
ones beside it; a poor imitation of a {ytable{x and {ychairs{x perhaps?  The only
exit from this place appears to be a door to the west

A {rr{Re{rd{x-shawled, ageless looking woman strides along purposefully.

The woman's face is unlined and unwrinkled, with an almost ageless
appearance that makes it hard to decide if she is young or old.  She wears a
{rr{Re{rd{x-fringed shawl, and an elegant silk dress.

an {gAv{Gen{gde{Gso{gra{x leaf key~
A {gg{Gree{gn{x lizard is camouflage in the garden.
~
A small {gli{Gza{grd{x is here, enjoying the beauty of this garden.  It basks in
the {Ys{yu{Yn{x, warming its scaled skin on a {gl{Gea{gf{x that blends into the {Ds{wt{Wo{wn{De{x wall. 
If it were to move, its skin would change color to keep it camouflaged and
safe from harm. Perhaps the leaf this reptile sits on is part of the waygate.
You should look to see what condition it is in to see if it is useable.

ranging from students' clothing, to linen from the {yki{Ytch{yens{x, to fine silk

The {DK{xe{Wep{xe{Dr of the Ch{xro{Wni{xcl{Des{x' Office~
The office is decorated in a comfortable, but professional style.  The
floor is a beautiful polished {rr{Re{rds{Rt{Wo{rn{re{x and there is a large {rf{yi{Yre{Wpl{Ya{yc{re{x set in
the far wall.  The walls are covered with two long {gt{xa{Dp{Ye{xst{Yr{Di{xe{gs{x, both which
seem to tell a story.  On one side of the room a massive {yt{xe{ra{ykw{ro{xo{yd{x desk
captures the eye with an impressive armchair behind it and several other
chairs placed in front.  Before the fireplace, a less formal seating area is
made up of a small {Ds{mo{xf{Da{x and two {Da{mr{xm{Wc{mh{Wa{xi{mr{Ds{x arranged around a low coffee
table.  The room is beautiful with a touch of austerity and power that the
position of the {DK{xe{Wep{xe{Dr of the Ch{xro{Wni{xcl{Des{x commands.

Study of the {WA{gm{yy{Dr{Yl{ri{bn {DS{ye{ga{Wt{x~
This room speaks of the power wielded by the long line of women who have
occupied it.  The floor is of polished {rr{Re{rds{Rt{Wo{rn{re{x from the {DMountains{x of {DM{Wi{xs{Dt{x
and the tall fireplace is of {yg{Yolde{yn{x Kandori marble.  The walls are paneled
in {Wpale{x, oddly striped wood, marvelously carved with unknown birds and
beasts more than a thousand years old.  Stone-like {Dg{cl{xi{Dt{Wte{Dr{xi{cn{Dg{x pearls frame
the tall arched windows that look out over the {WA{gm{yy{Dr{Yl{ri{bn{x's Garden below.  A
massive desk of {Ddark {rma{Dh{rogan{Dy{x wood is placed on one side of the large room,
an ornately carved chair of matching {rw{Do{rod{x sitting behind it.  On the other
side of the room, a small {Dl{mo{xv{Wes{xe{ma{Dt{x is arranged around a low coffee table,
completed with two {Dm{ma{xt{Wch{xi{mn{Dg{x armchairs.

A walkway leads north to a large {csquare{x before the enormous {WWhite Tower{x. 
From here, a person would have to crane her neck to see the top of the
Tower.  To the east and west runs a wide {Dst{Wo{xn{De{x walkway, leading around the
Tower grounds.  To the south is {yTa{Yrlom{yen{x's Gate, which opens south to the
city.

Tower Grounds - Inside {yTa{Yrlom{yen{x's Gate~
The massive Tarlomen's Gate is here to the south, which opens up to the
city of Tar Valon.  From it, a cobblestone path leads north, straight to the
awe-inspiring White Tower.  It rises high into the air, seeming to touch the
sky.  To the north is an intersection with the east-west main path which
leads around the Tower grounds, and the Tower itself.

The gatehouse for Tarlomen's Gate is made of a firm {Wwhite{x stone.  Several
openings are in the walls to allow crossbow bolts to be shot out on either
side of the gate.  A stout, but very plain desk is against the far wall with
a chair on each side of it, perhaps a place for guests new to the city to
sit as they register.

Although smaller than the gates on the north and south sides of the Tower,
it is guarded just as heavily and leads to the city of Osenrein.  To the
south is a Guard House, allowing protection from the elements for those
Guards assigned to guard the gate.  To the west, the cobblestone path around

hollow tower, the entrance to the south just a large archway in the stone
wall, with nothing to keep out the elements.  

There is no ceiling, just {Wsmooth{x stone walls rising upward.  Far above, a
massive {Db{yel{Dl{x hangs, visible to the outside through the openings in the stone
on three sides.  A lone, wrist-thick {yro{Yp{ye{x hangs down from above, and is
looped a few times around a large {Dhook{x mortared into the wall at waist

Tower Guard Area - {cG{Cu{Wa{Cr{cd{x {WBarracks{x~
This room is large, almost cavernous.  Plain cots line each undressed
{Ds{xto{Dne{x wall, along with small chests and {Da{xr{Wm{xo{Dr{x stands.  The floor is of
unpolished {yo{Ya{yk{x planking, worn rough by years of heavy tread upon it.  A
large {rfi{Rr{Ye{Wp{Yl{Ra{rce{x dominates the far end of the room.  There is always a large
{Dkettle{x hanging over the fire, simmering with hot drink.

Four comfortable looking beds, perfectly made up with {Wwhite{x sheets and
{Dg{xre{Dy{x blankets, occupy one wall of this room.  Each one is accompanied by a
{Ypine{x chest at its foot, and an {Da{xr{Wm{xo{Dr{x stand next to it.  The room is fairly
large, so there is no crowding.  A crossed {Ds{xw{Wo{xr{Dd{x and {ys{xp{We{xa{yr{x is hung above the
large {rfi{Rr{Ye{Wp{Yl{Ra{rce{x, which dominates the wall opposite the beds.  A {Dbattered{x

entertaining his guests.  Near the far wall is a low {ytable{x atop a {Dco{rl{Ror{rf{Dul{x
rug.  In the center of the table is a small vase, filled with {mc{Mh{Wer{Mr{my{x
blossoms, their light scent filling the air.  Near the table is a large
{Dw{Cindo{Dw{x which lets {ys{Yunligh{yt{x stream in.  On the adjacent wall is a tall
{ybo{Wo{ykc{Wa{yse{x, filled with a number of volumes.  Judging by their titles, the
topics cover a wide range, from battle tactics to history to even a few
books of poetry.  Further to the west, a door opens into the {cC{Ca{Wpta{Ci{cn{x's

covered in {yfurs{x occupies another corner.  Next to it is a bedside {ytable{x,
which holds a thick {yc{Wandl{ye{x and an old-looking {ybo{Wo{yk{x.  A small bookshelf sits
next to the wall near the fireplace.  Several {rle{Rath{rer{x wing-back chairs are
gathered around the fireplace with a small {ytable{x between them.  Near the bed
is a large window, and next to that is a tall {rm{Da{rhoga{Dn{ry{x wardrobe.  The floor

to the south, it leads to the {WLi{cb{Cr{ca{Wry{x and the {DE{gl{Gd{ge{Dr Grove{x.  To the east and

The plain boulder-{Dg{xre{Dy{x stone walls of the northern gatehouse are broken
only by large, barred windows that look out onto each side of the gate. 
Beneath each window are {Ds{xt{We{xe{Dl{x mounts to help brace heavy crossbows.  Several
additional arrowslits are scattered throughout every wall but the west, thus
allowing many angles to train a weapon upon a target.  {yD{Dar{yk{x beams jut
upwards from the corners then lean in to help provide support for the peaked
roof.

directly to the south.  The back of the building is faintly visible through
the dark green foliage, showing what appears to be {cc{Cra{Wsh{Cin{cg{x waves frozen in
{Wpale{x stone streaked with {cb{Clu{ce{x.  The path divides to the east and west,

including the smattering of {mw{gil{rdf{Rl{row{ger{ms{x shooting up just off the path, far
different from the planned, cultured gardens in other parts of the grounds.
Dandelions that would be common weeds elsewhere take on a {Dm{cy{xs{Wti{xc{ca{Dl{x quality,
the fairy-like {Wwh{xi{Wte g{xl{Dob{xe{Ws{x of seeds hovering above the green stems.
Woodland {gferns{x dance softly on the light {Wbreeze{x, and animals do not fear to
tread.

Orderly rows of bookcases fill the room, the smell of old {yleather{x and
paper potent to the senses.  This room holds some of the Tower's most prized

Tower Grounds - Outside the Blacksmith~
The sounds of the smithy can be heard just to the west, and the flames
from the forges are visible.  The grass on both sides of the stone path is
worn, as though this area sees a lot of traffic.  Back to the east, this
walkway intersects with the main guard path.

Tower Grounds - The Blacksmith~
Two stone-sided forges glow; lit by coals wavering between {rred{x and {Wwhite{x
with the occasional {Dd{xa{Drk{x spot or flickering {bbl{Bu{be{x flame.  Hand bellows are
next to the forges ready to pump air across the embers.  A variety of
hammers and tongs of differing sizes hang from a wall pegboard.  Bins hold
{Diron{x ingots, scraps of {Ds{xt{We{xe{Dl{x, and slagged {ybr{Yon{yze{x bits.  Four grinding wheels
provide for different degrees of coarseness and each rests upon the
hard-packed earthen floor.  Next to a row of anvils are three quenching
barrels; one each of fresh water, salt water, and oil.

Breaking off of the main guard path to the west, eastward this walkway
leads to the practice yards and guard offices.  The stones here look a touch
more worn than those of the main paths, as though this area sees a lot of
foot-traffic.  To the west it meets up with the East Guard Path.

A number of {cG{Cu{War{Cd{cs{x can be seen stretching and warming up here, readying
themselves for their daily workout.  To the sides of the area, there are
some low {ybeams{x on which to stretch, and next to them sits a small {yc{Dh{ye{Ds{yt{x,
which holds a number of practice weapons.  There are a few practice dummies
on the southern edge of this area, and they all seem to have seen better
days.  To the north, a large structure stands, the doorway always open.

lines along the dais, used by the {cO{Cff{Wic{Cer{cs{x when they call a meeting. 
Between the dais and the door are many rows of plain, wooden {ychairs{x used by
the rest of the Guard.  The acoustics in the auditorium are quite good, so
that whoever stands at the podium can be heard by all, even if speaking in
just a {Wwhisper{x.  A few small, high {Dw{Cindow{Ds{x line the room, with large {Dl{ya{Ym{yp{Ds{x

the {WTower{x holding steadfast against the {Dblack{x-veiled Aiel.  A large mural of
goat-horned humanoids confronting a {Ggreen{x-clad woman with a semi-circle of
three armed men in front of her.  Painted {Mp{xu{Wrp{ml{Me{x-{Ww{mh{Mi{xt{We{x streaks of lightning
crash amongst the hordes tossing chunks of the ground into the air.  Racks
of practice swords and staves are built into the walls.  Pegs and hooks

A Basement Hallway~
The warren of hallways is lit by lamps in {Di{Wr{Don{x wall brackets, and they
all seem very similar, making it hard to keep one's bearings.  The air is
cold and damp, deep beneath the busy main levels of the Tower.  The walls
are {Wpale{x stone without ornamentation, and the bare stark floor is uncovered.
The basement storerooms are rumored to be concealed in the walls, only
visible by a faint outline in the pale stone.

A Forgotten Storeroom~
A thick coating of undisturbed {Ddust{x lays over everything in this room,
indicating that no one has been in here in a very long time.  The objects in
the room seem to be mostly ancient, damaged furniture of some sort or
another, including a {Dm{ra{Dssi{rv{De black{x oak wardrobe.  One of its doors hangs
partially open on a broken, {rr{Ru{Yst{Re{rd{x hinge.

A Small, Out of the Way Room~
Three flickering {yla{Ynter{yns{x light this room, which is rather bare.  The
walls and ceiling are a plain {Wwhite{x, and the obvious focal point of the room
is the large ter'angreal which rests right in the middle.  The {WChair{x of
{DRemorse{x.  It is hard as steel and shaped like a block of {Dgr{xa{Dy ma{xr{Wb{Dle {xwith a
slanted top.  Whenever someone sits on it, the top seems to conform to them.
On one side of the {WChair{x is a small rectangular hole, about the size of a
hand, into which the {WPower{x is woven, when the {DChair{x is being used.

The air is quite chilly, and somewhat dank.  Dust lies heavy on everything
in sight, and no torches or lamps are seen in the {Di{xr{Don{x sconces on the walls.
It is evident that this level of the tower has been {rab{Ra{Dn{xd{Do{Rn{red{x for centuries.

A Well-Traveled Path~

from the lack of greenery and the cracking {Dsoil{x from heavy wagon wheels and
carts.

Outside {DA{x {rMa{Dide{rn's{x {mK{Dis{ms{x Inn~
A well traveled packed {yd{ri{yrt{x road continues its way through the city, away
from the northern gates leading to the White Tower.  The hustle and bustle
of the city is eminent here, with carts, animals and people everywhere.  A
rather non-descript building rises so the south, {ybrown{x with {Wwhite{x trim
around the windows and front door.  It fits in with the other structures
around it, but something about it seems very inviting.

The Common Room~
A gust of {Wbreeze{x through the door marks the comings and goings of the
people, the breeze causes the numerous {Wca{Yndl{Wes{x that light the room to
flicker briefly before stilling once more in their {Dholders{x.  Round tables
with chairs take up the middle of the room with seats enough for four while
along the walls booths with padded benches can seat up to six comfortably. 
On the wall farthest from the door is a long bar with stools infront of it,
behind the bar stands George the bartender and owner of the Maiden.  Serving
women move to and fro from both the bar and the kitchen to the tables,
serving drinks and food to the patrons as they come in.  The atmosphere of
the Maiden's Kiss is calm and relaxing, more suited for couples almost
except that here and there games of cards and dice are being played.  A door
to the east is usually kept closed while a small hallway leads past the
kitchen door to the south.

of the hall, silencing any footsteps so that the occupants of the rooms may

The rooms have a small sign on them with just a number on them, the western
door has the number 1, the southern has 2 and the eastern has 3 on it. 
There is just two lanterns in this end of the hall, both near the corners of
the hall between the three doors, shedding enough light to see but not to

The Amyrlin's Sitting Room~
This room seems almost {yd{ra{yr{rk{x in comparison to most rooms.  Two out of the
four walls covered with a deeply {ys{rta{yi{rne{yd{x walnut wood, the large carved
{yp{ra{yn{re{yl{rs{x adding a warmth to the room.  The third wall is mostly obscured by
large {ys{rhe{yl{rve{ys{x filled with {gb{bo{ro{Dk{ms{x and {Wn{Di{yc{x-{Dn{Wa{yc{Ys{x.  Occupying much of the center
of the room are two large over stuffed {rc{mo{ruch{me{rs{x.  The deep {rb{mu{rrgun{md{ry{x colored
fabric setting off the {yc{ro{yl{ro{yr{x of the walls and tying it all together.  There
are three {Dt{ya{rbl{ye{Ds{x, one set between the {rc{mo{ruch{me{rs{x.  On one of them stands an
ornately carved {WLion{x, the {Wlight{x colored {Wstone{x making it stand out starkly. 
At the fourth wall is two large column {cw{Ci{Wndo{Cw{cs{x, the view facing south out
over the island and the lands beyond.  

As you walk around the room and stop to notice the {rta{Rp{We{Yst{Wr{Ri{res{x on the walls
you realize that one of the {yp{ra{yn{re{yl{rs{x is oddly carved, a small {Dlatch{x about
waist height makes it swing open showing the {mbe{Dd{mr{Do{mom{x to the west.

The Amyrlin's chambers~
The {mbr{Mi{Wghtn{Me{mss{x of this room compared to the Office before it, makes the
eyes need a moment to adjust. The entire southern wall is made up of large
column {cw{Ci{Wndo{Cw{cs{x that are almost always left opened.  The wind makes the
light {ms{Wh{me{We{mr{x {mc{Wur{mta{Win{ms{x billow dramatically each time the door is opened. 
Butted up against the north wall is a large over-sized {ybed{x, covered in a
rather simple {mbla{Mn{mket{x that looks to have been bought recently and more
{mp{wi{Dl{Ml{Do{ww{ms{x than four people could ever need or want, with its four {ypost frame{x
almost reaching the {Wceiling{x.  Matching {ms{Wh{me{We{mr c{Wu{mr{Wt{ma{Wi{mn{Ws{x hang from the bed,
lending a sense of privacy to whomever is in it, but also from the doorway
acting as an effective {ysc{mr{We{yen{x to someone who may be dressing out of the huge
{ywar{Ddr{yobe{x on the other side of the bed.  On the east wall just out of reach of
the door is a small dressing {ytable{x with a long {Dm{wi{Wrr{wo{Dr{x.  Atop of it are a few
neatly placed items, a {Ds{wi{Wl{wv{De{wr{x beauty set arranged across it's surface.  On
the back of them is inscribed the initials {DC{WM{x.  In front of the {cw{Ci{Wndo{Cw{cs{x sit
two {mo{Wv{mer{x-{mst{Wu{mff{We{md{x chairs, over their backs drape lovely {mk{Mn{wi{Wt{wt{Me{md{x blankets.  

Off in the far west corner is an open door, from here you can make out the
edge of a {Dt{wu{Db{x and what looks like a {Ds{wi{Dn{wk{x.

A Little Girls Room~
As you leave the prim and proper {rsi{yt{rt{yi{rng{x room this room strikes you as
{Wbr{Yi{Mg{Wht{x and almost over-powering.  

Looking around, the {Wr{Yo{Mo{Wm{x begins to grow on you.  The {Wwalls{x are left the
pristine {Wwhite{x of the Tower.  It seems to make up for the fact that there is
only one {cw{Ci{Wnd{Co{cw{x in this room looking out over the Tower grounds.  There is a
full size {Mdo{Yub{Mle {yb{We{yd{x, nestled up against the {Wwall{x.  {MDr{Yap{Med{x from the {Wceiling{x
to the {yfloor{x is a {Ms{Yh{Me{Ye{Mr{x curtain that lends a protective feel to the {yb{We{yd{x. 
The few simple {Mp{Yi{Wllo{Yw{Ms{x are mostly obscured by {yte{Dd{ydy {Dbe{ya{Drs{x and {Yd{yo{Wl{yl{Ys{x that are
neatly piled at the head of the {yb{We{yd{x.  Along the same {Wwall{x is a large {ydr{Wess{yer{x
and matching {ywa{Wrdro{ybe{x, the pale {yw{Woo{yd{x matching the {yhea{Wdbo{yard{x of the {yb{We{yd{x. 
Infront of the {cw{Ci{Wnd{Co{cw{x sits a small {yta{Wb{yle{x and matching {ych{Wai{yrs{x, a {Mde{Yco{Wr{Yat{Med{x
box sits in the centre of the {yta{Wb{yle{x, filled with {Wpapers{x and {Dcharcoal{x for
drawing and such.  Off to the end of the {yb{We{yd{x is a beautiful little {ydr{Wessi{yng{x
table, complete with {Dm{wirro{Dr{x.  Strewn across the top is a {Ds{wi{Wl{wve{Dr{x beauty set,
complete with {Dh{wai{Wr{Db{yrus{Dh{x, {Dc{Wom{Db{x and hand {Dm{wirro{Dr{x.  Tacked to the {Wwall{x beside
the {Dm{wirro{Dr{x are {Mst{Yri{Mps{x of {Ysh{Me{Yer {Mfa{Ybri{Mcs{x that are tied into multiple knots,
{Db{warr{We{wtte{Ds{x are clipped it it, the knots preventing them from falling to the
floor.  

All the {yfur{Wnit{yure{x is oddly pushed to the edges of the {Wr{Mo{Yo{Wm{x except for one
large over {Yst{Wuff{Yed{x chair, that looks to be capable of holding two people. 
Beside it is a small {yta{Wb{yle{x with a book resting upon it.  On the same {Wwall{x as
the door are two large book {ysh{Welv{yes{x and a large pale {yw{Wo{yod{We{yn{x trunk.

A {bB{Blu{be {bS{Bi{bster{B'{bs{x Sitting Room~
The sitting room off the main office is large and airy, the {Wwh{wi{Wte{x marble
walls unpainted and reflecting the {yl{Yi{Wg{Yh{yt{x from the {cwi{Cn{Wd{Co{cws{x that dominate one
wall.  In the center of the room sits a large couch that would easily
accommodate four people.  The {bn{Bav{by {Bb{blu{Be{x cushions are large and well-stuffed,
but not uncomfortably so.  Bracketing the couch on each end are a pair of
matching {Wwhite{x high-backed armchairs.  Decorating the backrest of each chair
are innumerable tiny {Cb{Blu{Ce{x lilies that form the ancient symbol of the Aes
Sedai.  In front of the couch sits a large, sleek {Dgrey{x marble table with
{Dmatching{x smaller tables beside each of the chairs.  

Against the wall opposite the {cwi{Cn{Wd{Co{cws{x stands a large {Darmoire{x that opens up
to reveal an assortment of glasses and bottles.  Covering the floor between
the couch and chairs lies a large, thick {Bblue{x and {Wwhite{x rug.  Beyond the
couch lies the {Ddoor{x that leads to the private bedroom

king-sized canopied {yo{Da{yk{x frame, with a mattress of {Wfea{yth{Wers{x.  Lace of both
{Bb{blu{Be{x and {Wwhite{x drape the canopy.  A silk quilt of {bnavy{x and {Bblue{x rests atop
{Wwhite{x silk sheets.  Three large pillows of {bb{Blu{be{x and {Wwh{wi{Wte{x lie at the head of
the bed, against the {yoa{Dk{yen{x headboard.  A large pristine {Wwhite{x trunk rests at
foot of the bed.  Four small {yo{Da{yk{x tables are placed about the room, each with
a large crystal vase containing lilies of {Rf{Yi{rr{Re{x, and {Wlight {Cb{Blu{Ce{x.  A large
finely detailed {yo{Da{yk{x wardrobe rests on one side of the bed.  Two large
windows take up the east wall, draped with silken tapestries of {Bb{bl{Bu{be{x and

The Assistant Mistress of {WNovices{x' Sitting Room~
The sitting room is hushed and comfortable, suitable for quiet
contemplation or reading.  The floor is completely covered by a {Wwh{wi{Wte{x rug
with a {Dn{wa{Drrow {Dblack{x border, and in the center of the rug are seven symbols
of the Aes Sedai, one of each Ajah's {Bc{go{Yl{Ro{Wu{yr{x set in a circle.  In each corner
of the room, a {yl{Ya{Dm{yp{x is fastened to the wall, and below each sits a small
{ywooden corner table{x, a vase filled with {Wlilies{x standing on each.  

On the wall with the door from the office and the wall across the room are a
pair of {gta{Gpe{yst{Gri{ges{x, each depicting a tranquil nature scene of open {gf{Gi{gelds{x or
{gf{Go{yre{Gs{gts{x.  The lone {Ww{wi{Wndow{x stands in the center of the far wall, a table
below it where a small teaset of {cS{Ce{Wafo{Cl{ck{x {Cporcela{ci{Cn{x sits.  The two side walls
are almost completely hidden by {ybookcases{x except for the door in the north
wall that leads to the bedroom.  

The {Wair{x in the room is perfumed with the scent of the {Wl{wi{Wl{wi{Wes{x, lending a
pleasant quality to the room.

The Assistant Mistress of {WNovices{x' Bedroom~
The room before you is tidy and well-appointed.  A soft {gg{Gr{geen{x {Gr{gu{Gg{x covers
much of the floor, looking almost like a carpet of {gg{Gra{gss{x.  The largest piece
of furniture is easily the king-size bed sitting in the southeast corner of
the room.  A heavy {yo{ra{yk {yf{rram{ye{x with four large {yposts{x supports a mattress of
soft {Wfe{wa{Wthers{x and a soft {gg{Gr{geen{x {gs{Gi{glk{x {gc{Goverle{gt{x with three pillows of a {gdarker
green{x hue spread across it.  The headboard has a scene of a field of {yw{Yh{yeat{x
carved into its surface, the detail exquisite.  

Sitting beside the bed, just below the large {Ww{wi{Wndow{x, is a {ys{roli{yd {yo{ra{yk{x desk
with a chair padded in {gg{Gr{geen {gs{Gi{glk{x.  Various {ybooks{x and {Wpapers{x are scattered
across the surface of the desk, a small vase of {Wflowers{x at each of the back
corners.  On the north wall are a pair of large {yo{ra{yk {ywardrobes{x and a large
{ycabinet{x with a wide shelf where a {Wwas{wh{Wbas{wi{Wn{x sits.  A {yl{Ya{Dm{yp{x on a stand sits in
the southwest corner beside an {gov{Ger{gstuf{Gf{ged{x {gg{Gr{geen{x chair with a footrest, a
small {ytable{x piled high with books on the other side.

mind to each other, only looking around themselves in {ma{Ww{me{x, thinking of where
they are, and why.  The {Wpa{xl{We{x stone floor has been worn and polished by
countless nervous feet over the centuries.  Laid out in the middle of the

the pale smooth stone seem {rw{ya{Yr{rm{x, and aglow with life.  A pair of girls in
{Wwhite{x dresses with {gb{ya{Dn{Yd{re{bd{x hems come out of the door to the east, talking
quietly with each other.

A raised {Dplatform{x runs around the outer edge of the room, fronted by steps
except where the ramps lead up into the room.  

Spaced around the room on the platform, are twenty-one chairs, in groupings
of three, each triad {mp{Ma{xin{Wte{md{x and cushioned in the same color as the ajah to
which they belong.  The {WFlame of Tar Valon{x lies centered in the floor,
surrounded by widening spirals of color, the colors of the seven Ajahs.  At
the north side of the room a high backed chair stands, heavy and {Do{mr{xn{Wat{xe{ml{Dy{x

Western {rAe{Rs{r Se{Rd{rai{x {DCo{wr{Wri{wd{Dor{x~
Several smooth-faced {Rr{red{x and {Dg{xray shawled Aes Sedai walk along the
hallway going about their tasks.  A large {Dt{ra{Rp{we{Ds{Rt{rr{Dy{x hangs on the western
wall, well-cared for, but obviously very old.  A {Wnovice{x heads south, hoping
she manages to slip down a staircase before an Aes Sedai puts her to work at
a mundane task.

Top of Stairway - Aes Sedai Level~
The {Ws{ct{xa{Di{cr{Ws{x spiral up to the Aes Sedai floor, and a glance down the hall
shows women in shawls striding purposefully, with the occasional student and
servant girl.  It seems that guests and men are not allowed here, unless
expressly invited.  The spiraling staircase leads downward toward the main

Two giggling novices stand talking with dust-cloths in hand.  A narrow
block of {cg{Dra{Wn{Dit{ce{x serves as a pedestal for a porcelain vase dated at least
300 years old.  The vase is a muted {Wc{Yr{Weam{x color with a pattern of small,
delicate ivy painstakingly painted over it's surface.  The {Wnovices{x pay
little attention to the {Wva{Ys{We{x as they giggle and dust.

A {gG{Gree{gn Si{Gst{ger{x's Sitting Room~
This room appears to be a small comfortable looking sitting room. A large 
{gg{Gree{gn{x couch rests against the far wall, next to a large {Dw{Cindo{Dw{x with a large
window-seat beneath it.  There are quite a few {ytables{x with chairs along the
other walls, ready to be used.  Fresh arrangements of {gf{rlo{mw{rer{gs{x rest in vases
on many of the {ytables{x, filling the room with their light, {Wairy{x scent.  Next
to a {Bv{Cas{Be{x on one table sits a small picture showing a young Saldaean girl
sitting next to her mother. The frame is carved to show small {Dblack{x thorns.

{YSunlight{x streams through the open windows in this bedroom as the light,

decorated in neutral colors.  The bed, which sits in the corner, is made of
solid {yoak{x and is covered with a simple {gg{Gree{xn and {Wwhite{x quilt.  A simple,
{ywooden{x table sits next to bed and holds a {Bb{Clu{Be{x vase filled with fresh
{gwi{mld{rflo{mwe{grs{x.  Beside the vase rests some loose hairpins and a delicate
{Dsi{xlv{Wer c{xo{Dmb{x holding some stray strands of long, curly {rr{Re{rd{D-{yg{Yol{yd{x strands
of{x hair.  Also, some comfortable-looking chairs sit in a corner, next to a

with books, parchment and an {Dinkwell{x and quill.

This room seems to combine the {ci{Wn{xt{Dim{xa{Wt{ce{x aspects of a small sitting room
with the more businesslike aspects of a private study rather well.  A large
{gg{Gr{We{Ge{gn{x and {Wwhi{xt{We{x rug covers most of the floor.  A small oak desk occupies one
corner of the room, complete with a {ggre{Ge{gn{x-brocaded chair behind it, and two
straight-backed {yoak{x chairs before it.  An elegant {ggre{De{gn{x silk couch, with two
{yleather{x wing chairs to either side make a cozy conversation grouping at he
other side of the room.  Various large paintings grace the walls, mostly
{rba{Rtt{rle{x scenes, and one, a view of Dragonmount from the walls of Tar Valon.

Narrow windows, almost like arrow slits, line one wall of this room.  A

suit of plate mail is fully assembled on a rack in one corner, complete with
{Dsw{xo{Wrd{x and shield.  Throwing daggers are scattered casually across the top of
a small, square table.  The {ywa{rrdro{ybe{x, one door open so its contents are
visible, shows fully as many breeches as skirts.  Crammed with literature on
{rta{Rc{Wti{Rc{rs{x, history, and all thngs military, the bookshelves seems likely to
collapse under the weight.

A small, uncluttered desk of {Wwhi{yt{We {yo{Wak{x rests in a corner of this room,
the matching chair upholstered in {Wwh{xit{We silk{x.  The walls are unadorned,
though one entire wall seems to consist mostly of a {Ch{Wug{Ce{x window with an
excellent view.  A narrow, uncomfortable looking couch sits {yun{Ygra{ycefu{Yll{yy{x in

A {WWhite{x Sister's Bedroom~
This fair-sized room looks smaller due to how the furniture is arranged. 
The middle of the room is dominated by a large, low square {yoak table{x with
several {Dwriting {Winst{wr{Wuments{x and a {ct{Ce{Was{Ce{ct{x on it.  Four {yp{wa{Wdd{we{yd chairs{x sit
under it of the same construction.  There is no bed in the room at all,
instead, a large {Wnetl{wi{Wke{x object is strung so that it hangs easily in one
corner.  The floor is completely covered by a {ylarge rug{x, stretching from one
wall to the other except for a small area around the {rfi{Rre{Yp{Rla{rce{x.  

The wall across from the door, which is the largest of the three, has papers
nearly covering it, displaying a {ym{ra{yp{x.  Suspended on the wall near a {Wbat{wh{Wtub{x,
a large {ct{Capestr{cy{x depicts an {co{Ccea{cn {Csce{cne{x.  A {Wfold{wi{Wng {yscreen{x sits against
one wall, hiding all behind it and offering some privacy.

The {yBrown Ajah{x~
Women stroll down the hall, nearly all of them wearing {ybrown{W-{yfringed{x
shawls.  This is their section of the Tower, and they are on their native
turf.  To the west lies the main Aes Sedai corridor, and stairs leading up
to the next level of the brown ajah's rooms are to the east.  A {yBrown{x
{ySister{x's chambers are to the south, and the Ajah's conference room is
through the heavy double doors close by to the north.

The {yBrown Ajah's Sitting{x Room~
This room is the sitting room for the Ajah's general use.  Sisters gather
here to talk or meet with {cgu{Ces{cts{x when they feel that their own chambers are
not appropriate.  A {Wlinen{x-covered couch sits in the middle of the room,
flanked by two matching armchairs.  A {Dv{ra{ws{De{x of {mpans{Yi{mes{x sits on a low table in
front of the couch.

A large circular {ychestnut{x-wooded conference table fills the room,
surrounded by ornately carved chairs.  A bookshelf stands against one wall,
and on another, a painting of {yBalla Arandaille{x, a historic past Amrylin Seat
from the Brown Ajah, is placed.  A large silver {Wpi{Dt{mc{Dh{Wer{x stands on a tray at
one end of the table along with several glasses.  A large window shows the
city of Tar Valon and it's neighboring villages.

As the door opens, a stack of {ybo{ro{yks{x placed too near the entrance topples
over.  A woman turns to look toward the entrance in befuddled confusion.  An
{yar{Ym{W-{yc{Yh{yair{x sits in one corner with several books stacked on a nearby end
table.  A half-eaten {ga{Gpp{gle{x sits next to the books, beginning to turn moldy.

papers.  In the center of the table a workspace is cleared and papers are
neatly stacked.  One stack of blank pages, and another of pages filled with
fine black handwriting.  Several small boxes are close at hand on the {ytab{rl{ye{x,
each labeled only with a drawing of a {gp{Gl{gant{x.  Against another wall is
another, smaller table.  It is carefully supplied with pens, {Dink pots{x and a
small stack of noteboks, giving no excuse to the novices that find
themselves seated there for not copying pages for the {yBrown Sister{x.

A plush {bn{Da{Bv{by{x couch stands in the center of the room, but has the
appearance of disuse.  The main activity takes place at a large {yt{wa{rb{wl{ye{x along
one wall, papers and books strewn over it.  As is expected in a Brown's

if plenty of work is done in here as well as the study.  A {rn{Digh{rtst{Dan{rd{x is
woefully incapable of containing the parchment, writing utensils, books and
{Wcandles{x that have been placed on it, and several items lay on the floor
nearby where they've falled off, forgotten.  The king-sized bed is {ms{Mtr{mewn{x
with loose sheets of parchment, some {yye{Yll{yowe{Yd{x with age, others crisp and

while to the south is the door to the Accepted Sitting Room, a room set
aside for the Accepteds' leisure time.  Small groups of girls stand in
clusters around the hallway, chatting {Wsoftly{x and delaying their departure to
various classes and {ychores{x.

An {WA{gc{yc{De{Yp{rt{be{Wd{x Bedroom~
This room, while not tiny, is by no means large.  The furniture consists
of a narrow {Ymap{yl{Ye{x bed, a small {Ymap{yl{Ye{x desk with a matching straight-backed
chair and a small {yo{Ya{yk{x table upon which rests a pitcher and basin.  A thick

relax and talk quietly with each other.  A large {rf{Rir{Ye{Wp{Yl{Rac{re{x casts a rosy glow
when needed, and is kept carefully clean otherwise.  Several tables are
placed about the room, though most Accepted would rather study in the
comfort of their own room.  Plush comfortable couches and armchairs welcome
the initiates to put up their {Dtired{x feet and relax.

courtyard open to the sky above, it is used for only three purposes:
executions, the stilling of an Aes Sedai, or the gentling of a man who can
channel.  Whenever it is in use, the entire Tower, all the Aes Sedai,
Accepteds, Novices, and servants, gathers here to watch the will of Tar
Valon be carried out.  A number of {yba{Ylconi{yes{x surround the courtyard, looking
down on the {Wflagstone{x-paved area.  In the center of the courtyard, a number
of large, heavy {Di{xr{Don{x rings are attached to the floor with chains coming off
of them, suitable for restraining the person receiving judgement.

One large, prominent cage stands open, welcoming newly arrived pigeons,
bearing messages.  Several {Wnovices{x giggle as they clean out cages and fill

wall, depicting the {WWhite Tower{x before a {yse{Ytt{ying s{Yu{yn{x, looking picturesque,
and lovely.  To the west, the hallway meets up with the central corridor on
the Tower's main floor.

with the One Power.  An inviting {ysu{Yngwo{yod{x bed stands against one wall with a
wardrobe of matching wood.  A table in the corner holds various articles
including a stack of {ybooks{x, and a basin and pitcher for washing.  Placed on
a large blank wall, is a portrait of a woman wearing the stole of the
Amyrlin.

The frame is intricately carved with a pattern of ivy, painted in {bb{Bl{bue{x and
{Ygo{yl{Yd{x.  A blue-eyed woman with the stole of the Amyrlin draped over her
shoulders is depicted.  Her hair is dark as night, and her skin dark from
the sun.  Carved into the bottom of the frame are the words, "{cFeragaine

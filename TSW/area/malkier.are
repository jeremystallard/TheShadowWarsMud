a trolloc around these here parts, this one guards something.

managed to live through all that..  Will you be this {revil{x beast's bane?

it's features as it moves it's head around.  Always trying to keep alert

Overlooking the Corruption~
After having traveled through the {gb{Gl{rig{Gh{gt{x for a while, you notice a few
strange looking hills west of here.  The leafless, gray vegetation of {Wfr{Cig{Wid{x
north {BSh{Di{we{Dn{Bar{x has gradually changed, from an almost pleasant temperature to
a pressing, damp {rh{Rea{rt{x.  The opening lands west of here shows a network of
darkly {ws{Whinin{wg pools of {bb{Blu{be{x.  Perhaps a parched traveler could fill his
waterskins and find some relief in the cool waters.

Off the Path, Warm and Damp~
You're standing a bit north of the open trail west, the strange
{gve{Gg{yetat{Gi{gon{x is thick here.  One in tune with nature or otherwise sensitive
would find great offense in the corrupted trees and plants.  The leaves
aren't a healthy {gg{Gree{gn{x, nor are they the musky {rr{Re{rd {xand {yg{Yol{yd{x of fall.  Here,
sickly {Yyellow{x is spotted with mucky, bubonic {ybrown{x.  You can probably push
through a bit further west, but south feels more open.

North of the Main Path~
An {mac{rr{mid{x stench fills your nostrils, looking around you notice a
non-descreipt carcass slung over a broken tree-trunk a short distance away. 
It looks as if it was eaten from the inside, leaving little but skin and
slime for the circling {Dravens{x.  A thick group of {gb{mu{gsh{me{gs{x invites you over
with full {Yyellow{x berries and {bl{Divi{bd{x spots, just remember what your pappy used
to say about touching unknown berries..  Especially in the {rb{ml{gig{mh{rt{x.  The main
path lies south of here and a short trail between the hunched trees leads
east.

On the Main Path~
You are walking west on what appears to be the main trail through these
{Ddark{x lands.  Everything here stinks pretty bad, the very air is rotten, the
kind of sweet rotten scent a carved rat-corpse would emit after three days
in the sun.  The temperature is simply impossible for a location this far
north, this is the {yb{ml{cig{mh{yt{x, have no doubt.  The {Ddark-one{x's violation on the
{ymother{x.  West of here lies what's left of what was once proud {RM{ra{yl{Yk{yi{re{Rr{x and her
hundred {bl{Bake{bs{x.  Now nothing but {Dr{wu{ri{wn{Ds{x, {gj{mu{gng{ml{ge{x, and {rdis{ge{ra{gs{re{x remains.

Long Lost Beauty~
The deep vegetation opens up slightly, giving you a decent view of the
lands before you.  The land of the hundred {bl{Bake{s{x lies before you, the seven
rocky peaks shooting up of the rotting {gj{Gu{mng{Gl{ge{x must be what's left of the
seven {Dt{wo{Wwe{wr{Ds{x of {RM{ra{yl{Yk{yi{re{Rr{x.  Even in this wretched state, you can't help but
realize how {Wbeautiful{x theese lands must once have been.  A fallen tree
prevents further explorations westward, and you are forced to either return
east or go back north to the main path.

A Path Towards the {DT{wo{Wwe{wr{Ds{x~
The trail narrows slightly, forcing you to tear and push at the {Dm{re{Dnaci{rn{Dg{x
low branches grabbing for you, or are they just moving with the {mro{rtt{men{x wind?
You might not wish to stay and find out.  A few cracked {Ds{wtone{Ds {xare cluttered
with the regular floor of broken branches, plants and the occational bone.

Just South of the Path~
Here the vegetation is thick, various perversions of a tainted {gna{Gtu{gre{x
seems to grab at you, maybe they are.  The ground has some sporadic {Wb{wone{Ws{x
littered, as if someone or something, enjoyed a good meal here at some
point.  Whatever it was, it was big, and knowing where you are, likely nasty
as well.  The victim appears to have been some form of really big .. 
Something.  Meeting the diner is likely not something one would want to do. 
{rEerie{x sounds and a putrid {ybr{Ye{yeze {xof sulphur flops the sick leaves around,
possibly turning a sensitive human stomach, should one happen to wander
past.

At a Two-Way Intersection~
The {gr{Go{ra{gd{x west ends here, that much is for certain as a steep hill rises
where the trail was leading.  Thankfully, a tunnel in the {gj{Gu{yng{Gl{ge{x has been
stomped from north, through here, and southwards.  Maybe if you follow this
new trail you might still have a chance at reaching those cool {bw{Bater{bs{x
spotted earlier.  The air here buzzes annoyingly from a hundred angry
{yinsects{x, they don't appear to feel like a bite though.  Perhaps these
insects know better than to feed of what they find in the blight.

A Freak of Nature~
This tree is huge and cannot possibly have sprung so high in the
relatively short time since Malkiers fall, it is clearly a corrupted common
border-pine.  The abomination has sprung {Ys{Gi{Yc{Gk{Yl{Gy {Gy{Ye{Yl{Gl{Yo{Gw{x spines where
{Gw{Cint{Wer-{Cgre{Gen{x needles would have been.  The ground around it is filled with
knotted nastiness that can only be it's foul saplings.  There is no way
further north here, the jungle is just too {gdeep{x.  You must return from
whence you came.

the body of his partner, only with {ms{Glim{my{x branches and rancid {bv{mi{Cn{me{bs{x instead
of d{Welicat{xe fingers, or a hot {rt{Rongu{re{x.  There are some noises around you.

thankfully filtered away by the writhing walls of plant around you.

On the Twisting Path~
The claustrophobic trail widens, perhaps very little, yet still enough to
allow the broad-shouldered a normal walk.  The {Dp{gat{Dh{x may have turned while in
it's thickest stages.  There is no way to get your barings, for the coverlet
of sick leaves does not reveal the sky above more than the lids of {yr{Doo{Yt{x,
{bb{mu{ms{bh{x and {ybr{gan{ych{x.  All you can do is to continue on the chosen path, or turn
back into the {rvi{Do{wl{Wa{wt{Di{rng{x embrace of the blight {gju{Rn{ggle{x.

Shadowed Sightings~
The heavy air seems to lift just slightly as more space is added to each
of your sides.  The ground becomes more {Dro{xc{Dky{x as the {bj{gu{Gng{gl{be{x appear to
retreat, the further south you get.  Some kind of {rred gr{ya{rss{x seems to be
growing out of the hardening {gg{yroun{gd{x.  Nature, if one were to call this {yr{Ro{yt{x
nature, is surely swiftly shifting in the Blight.  As the jungle retreats
further, the {gm{Yois{gt{x increases even more and the {Wg{wl{Wi{wt{Wt{wr{Wi{wn{Wg{x {Ycelestial{x bodies
above reflects thair {!r{W{!a{Wy{!s{x off the, now nearby, network of {bl{Bake{bs{x.  G{Wleamin{xg
like sapphiers worthy a {rqu{ye{ren{x.  The Seven Towers can now easily be

teeth of a battle-scarred s{Wi{wl{Wv{we{Wr{Wp{wi{Wk{we{x.

Before One of Many {bL{Bake{bs{x~
The ground is here {Dp{de{Wb{db{Dl{xe{Dd{x with varying {Dminerals{x, all filing losely against
{Dst{wo{Dne{x.  You are constantly getting a little lower, here the ground slopes
further south towards a darkly {Dsh{wi{Wn{wi{Dng {bl{Bak{be{x of which the surface is but
barely glanced by the rolling {gb{Yreez{ge{x, lie still as a mirror.  A general
assortment of {Rfi{re{Dnd{ri{Rsh{x plantlife has lain {rs{Rieg{re{x to the fringe around the
waters edge, reminding the onlooker of what wicked {Dno{ru{Dr{wi{Ws{wh{Dm{re{Dnt{x must be

The {gw{Gr{gi{rth{gi{Gn{gg{x plantlife coils around unwary feet here, the pebbled {Db{weac{Dh{x
of the {Dl{ba{Dke{x south of here changes northwards to a forest path, where short,
bush-like trees have grabbed most of the available space.  A few {rme{Rn{racing{x
ripples on the surface of the lake urges even the brave to steer clear.  The
{rh{yea{rt{x is not quite as pressing this close to the water, though the
temperature and air is all but pleasant.  Strange, how what must once have
been such b{Weautifu{xl a land has now been {Ww{wa{mrp{we{Wd{x completely.  Can it's former
glory ever be restored?  The cost to drive the everpresent {yB{ml{yig{mh{yt{x north
again would be immense, who could afford to pay such a price?

On the Calm {bL{Bak{be{x~
The {gs{ct{yic{ck{gy {gw{ca{yt{ce{gr{x is cool, at least in comparison with the jungle behind. 
Even if it's surface is still and intact, except for where you've swum past;
it's interior is everything but calm.  {gS{wl{Wi{wm{gy{x, {gte{wn{Wta{Wc{gly{x things brush against
your feet now and then, just as some form of {Ra{rn{Dg{rr{Ry{x fish nibbles at your
extremities.  The water has a strange smell of {Dro{ytt{Den{x {Yf{yis{Yh{x, {yd{me{cc{ma{yy{x and {ri{Dro{rn{x,
making this swimming experience unpleasant.  The rocks south of here cannot
be scaled, leaving you with the option to either swim back to shore north,
or follow the {bl{Bak{be{x west.

enough room on both sides for a horse to get through.  Scavengers {bh{mow{bl{x their

by the thick roof of leaves is eerily {Cill{Wumina{Cted{x by sweet-smelling,
{Cp{ch{Co{cs{Cp{ch{Co{cr{Co{cu{Cs{x fungi.  In the distance, to the north, you spot some strange
bushes dotted with many {Gglowing b{ge{Gr{gr{Gi{ge{Gs{x.

Some Bloated Berries on the Path~
You have arrived at yet another {yf{mi{Mlt{mh{yy{x creation of the {DDark Ones{x tainted
touch.  Before you stands some sort of mix between a {mmu{rllber{mry{x bush and
something non-descreipt and {rnasty{x.  Instead of {gl{Ge{gaves{x or {gn{De{we{Wd{wl{De{gs{x, this
living {Yc{ya{rrca{rs{Rs{x of nature sports tentacle-like, mushy branches with {Gg{gl{Yo{Gw{ging{x
suction-cups.  It's {Yb{be{yrri{be{Ys{x are as big as plums, and {mb{Ml{Ro{Ba{Rt{Me{md{x to the brink of
explosion.  Judging from the {cs{mlim{ce{x around the thing, and on the surrounding
vegetation, the berries do not know when to stop growing.  A narrow
forest-trail leads south of here, while the land opens up to the west,
revealing a {gg{Gr{Das{Gs{gy{x hill.

At the Northeastern Base of a Hill~
The trail ends at a steep, grassy hill.  Thick {Gv{ge{bg{cetat{bi{go{Gn{x to your north
and south prevents alternate paths.  To get further west, you shall have to
climb the obstacle placed before you.  The higher ground seems to have had a
beneficial effect on this {gh{Gi{Dl{gl{x, the grass does appear {gg{Greene{gr{x on the other
side..  Or at least the higher up you look.  To the east the forest thickens
and {Ddarkens{x notably.  Angry, {rg{Rlo{Gw{Rin{rg{x {re{Rye{rs{x seem to stare out at you from the
{Dblackness{x.

On the Hill~
The sickening breeze hits you more directly when clear of the vegetation.
Originating from the {Dnorth{x, the wind has moved through many perversions
before squirming itself up your nostrils and {Wd{we{De{Wp{x into your lungs.  Even in
the {Dbor{wd{We{wr{Dlands{x, a gust of wind from the north can make a stomach queazy. 
Here it is far worse.  Higher ground gives the benefit of a good view of the
lands stretching out.  The {gs{Gq{gu{rirm{gi{Gn{gg{x jungle continues north, all the way to
the base of the ominous {DMou{rn{Dt{wa{Wins o{wf {DD{rh{Doom{x.

On the Northwestern Side of the Hill~
The hill slopes up and down with very few plain surfaces.  Something is a
little off with one of the {Dr{wu{ri{wn{Ds{x west of here, {Ws{wm{Do{wk{We{x is coming from it. 
Whoever is making that {Rf{Yir{Re{x is either a reckless fool, about to die from the
{ra{Rt{rt{Re{rn{Rt{ri{Ro{rn{x such a feat would grant, or someone powerful enough to pay the
price of it.  Interesting.  A dozen or so {Dr{ra{Dv{re{Dns{x are circling the skies high
above your head, squawking loudly with sarcasm.  Two of them swoop a bit
lower before heading north towards the {WM{wo{Dunta{Wi{wn{Ds{x.

Lower gound can be seen to the west, unless you chose to climb the {Dr{wo{Wc{wk{Dy{x
fifteen, or so, feet to the ground.  Below, a path littered with {Wwhite
stones{x leads around the hill.  The ground is a little slippery, as if newly
rained upon, and a {ggreen {gl{ciqui{gd{x of {Ga{glga{Ge{x-similar appearance dri{gz{Gz{xles down
the {Dr{wo{Wc{wk{Ds{x.

On the Southwestern Side of the Hill~
The ground sinks a little southwards and a descent further from here
would be easy, even for someone who does not climb.  A strange {Dblack{x circle
has been burned in the grass, almost as if some lost soul {rc{Ra{Ymp{Re{rd{x here
recently, though that couldn't very well be.  A few {Dr{ra{Dv{re{Dns{x cackle above you,
besides that.  This is a decent place to make camp, little vegetation
threatens to grope you, and the view around is good enough to give warning
if any of the Blights {Rd{re{Dnize{rn{Rs{x decided to charge out of their hiding-places
for a snack.  The rest of {rMa{yl{Yk{yi{rer{x lie west of here, or you can climb the
hill a little higher north or east.

You can follow the easy path ascending the {yg{Yr{Das{Ys{yy{x side of the hill here,
or head west towards the {bl{Bake{bs{x and the {Dt{wo{Wwe{wr{Ds{x.  Looking up you see a dozen
or so dark {Dspots{x that are likely {Dr{ra{Dv{re{Dns{x, all around you the sounds of the
{yGreat Blight{x fills the {ya{Yi{yr{x.  Buzzing insects, screeching birds, sniveling
snails, hissing snakes, all contributing in their own way to play a wholly
unpleasant melody.

likely making it both disgusting and {Dd{ri{Rf{Yfic{Ru{rl{Dt{x to climb.  The ground here is
covered with {Wwhite{w stones that on closer inspection are actually the remains
of a demolished {bw{Bel{bl{x.  {yTr{be{yes{x with their thick, gnarled {ybr{ban{yches{x appears to
be reaching for you from the east, while the path continues south along the

In the {DShadow{x~
The beckoning branches soon become threatening, as you continue east
towards the {Dshadows{x.  The path becomes narrower and narrower yet, until it
is simply not possible to tread it further for something of your size.  The
{Ysky{x manages to send some light through the branches above, though even {Wlight{x
filtered through such {mco{gr{Gr{gu{mp{rt{yi{Yo{yn{x is tainted, and only works to enhance the
offensive presence of this {yu{Yn{Bn{ba{Dt{bu{Br{Ya{yl{x plant-life.

A living wall of {ggreen{x, {bli{Dv{bid{x, {rred{x, {ybrown{x and {Wy{ye{Yllow{x stretches it's
{gt{Ge{bn{Dt{ra{yc{Yl{Ge{gs{x out at you.  If a monster is behind this messy mass, then it's
certainly big.  More likely is that these slippery {gf{Gi{Ren{Gd{gs{x are acting
independantly.  If you do manage to get free of this threat, you can head
back to the dark trees north of here, or back west straight towards the
large hill.  Maybe you can find some {Wsh{relt{Wer{x there.  A number of animal
{Wb{wo{Dn{we{Ws{x are spread out on the ground, picked clean of {rflesh{x.

{gd{Ge{Dep{Ge{gr{x into the {gj{Gu{Rng{Gl{ge{x, or west along the base of the hill.  Some distance
west of here, the ground lowers into a large {bl{Bak{be{x.

South of a Hill~
The {gtrai{Gl{x dwindles north up a hill at an easy climb.  East of here, the
jungle thickens, while it opens up further to your west.  The ever-present
corruption presents you with a few hideously twisted {Ws{wk{ye{wl{We{yto{wn{Ws{x, smashed
against the ground.  Some appear half-eaten, others are just broken.  They
are all, however, in a highly decomposed state.  Around the skeletons lie
pieces of broken {Dw{we{Wapo{wn{Ds{x and {Da{wr{Wm{wo{Dr{x.

West of a Hill, Before a {bL{Bak{be{x~
A large, quite steep hill is covering most of your field-of-vision to the
east.  Some tall {Gt{gr{be{ge{Gs{x stick up behind it, but that's all you can see.  High
in the {bs{Bk{by{x, some {Dr{ra{Dv{re{Dns{x circle ominously, occationally swooping down to get
a closer look at this rare intrusion in their domain.  A flat path, graveled
with {Wb{wo{Dn{ye{D-{wf{Wr{wa{Dg{yme{Dn{wt{Ws{x and {Dblack{x pebbles leads north of here.  Before you to
your west, another of {rMa{yl{Yk{yi{rer{x's many {bl{Bake{bs{x lie, it's surface rippled.

main path before you leads west into lake-land and towards the towers.  A
smaller, more heavily vegetated trail leads north of here, back into the
{gj{Gu{Bng{Gl{ge{x.

Northwest of a Large Hill~
A path runs around the hill to your east, apparantly towards the thicker
jungle behind the hill.  Following the same path west will take you north of
the dark, {br{Bi{W{bp{Wpl{Be{bd l{Bak{be{x southwest of here.  The steep, rocky slope east of
here, beside the path, can probably be scaled by a decent climber.  It isn't
more than twenty feet high, and the {rj{Ra{Dgg{Re{rd{x black {Dr{wo{Wc{wk{Ds{x provide plenty of
little trenches to grip.

Large quantities of insectoid larvae-like critters have {Yi{yn{rfest{ye{Yd{x most of
the trees growing here, making their trunks cr{ra{Rc{xk with displeasure.  A {yl{go{yg{x
has fallen across the path from the right, and some {ggreenish{x liquid {go{Go{Yz{Ge{gs{x
out of it's torn {ybark{x.  Vines dangle between the many trees, and you get the
feeling something watches you from above.  Looking up reveals nothing but
tree-crowns and sky, though.

The Disappearing Trail into the {yT{rh{Di{rc{yk{x~
An unbearable {ms{rt{men{rc{mh{x eminates from the east, where the {gu{bn{cd{De{wr{Wg{wr{Do{cw{bt{gh{x
becomes even thicker than it already is, which is saying a lot.  The {yg{Yr{ya{Ys{ys{x
here hasn't been touched in a while, and reaches as high as the chest of a
common male human.  Pressing on east takes a lot of effort, but can be done.
Some kind of animals shuffle around among the branches above you, chittering
amongst eachother.

The tall grass makes it impossible to see where you place your feet,
stumbling over something soft and smelly gets your attention.  Three
half-eaten, worm-infested {Dt{rr{Do{rl{Dloc{x corpses lies here, decomposing.  Judging
from their {rj{Ra{Dgg{Re{rd{x {yw{Yo{Run{Yd{ys{x, something with large {Wteeth{x came across them. 
Their entrails color the immediate region around them {Dblack{x.  A crashing
sound can be heard from the east, increasing in volume as it lumbers closer,
the only exit is back west where you came from.

direction.  Large waves toss you around from side to side, while agile
{Gt{ge{cn{ytac{cl{ge{Gs{x try to grab and pull you into the {Dd{be{Bpt{bh{Ds{x.  The water has a taste
of {ri{yro{rn{x to it, not unlike {rb{Rloo{rd{x.  The {bi{Bn{Cf{We{Cr{Bn{bo{x around you does not seem to
relent, this lake shall not rest again until it's intruders have been
purged, or {rd{ye{rv{yo{ru{yr{re{yd{x.

{ys{gm{Gell{ys{x none too pleasant, though.  This trail leads south towards an

Staring intently at the middle of the lake south of here, would reveal
not only ripples on it's surface, but also the {Ddark {yt{De{yn{Dt{ya{Dc{yl{De{ys{x below causing
them.  There is a {ycr{re{Ra{rt{yure{x down there, it is huge and worm-like.  It's
tentacles are each as long as a man and a half, {Ds{wp{Wi{wk{Ded{x with barbed {cs{Cp{yi{Cn{ces{x. 
The vegetation along the beach-promenade is slug-like and colored in
{ya{Yt{Mr{Co{Bc{Di{go{mu{rs{x variations.  Walking east of here would take you towards a large
hill, looming over the lake south of you.  The path west leads around the

Around the {bL{Bak{be{x~
The {D{ro{Dmin{ro{Du{ws{Wly{x rippling body of water is quite disturbing.  The slight
relief from the {Yheat{x, however, is pleasant.  Not to say that it isn't too
humid and stickily warm here, it's just less pressing than the higher land. 
Bloated water-insects lie {rd{Dyin{rg{x at the waters edge, giving off a stench far
surpassing old horse-urine on the nasty scale.  The path around the lake
continues east towards a {gh{Gi{Dl{gl{x, following it west will take you to sand
covered almost completely with heavy boulders.

Following this path east will take you around a {gh{Gi{Dl{gl{x and towards the {gd{Ge{De{rp{Ge{gr{x
{gj{Gu{yng{Gl{ge{x, while the road west of here leads downwards to a network of lakes
and an overgrown, {Ds{wton{Dy{x land.  Seven fallen towers stand {Ys{yi{rllh{yo{Yu{ye{wt{Dted{x

medium-sized boulders clumped together tightly enough to leap further west
on.  Not very far from here to the west, a long lake lies.  Flatter and more
vegetated is the path that can take you north to the western side of another

as if sentient, you soon find yourself covered with black {Dal{gg{Dae{x, quite
smelly.  A few oddly growing trees stick out from the {Ws{wh{Darp{x cliffs south of
here, three {Dr{ra{Dv{re{Dns{x perch there, observing you with {Ddead {Ye{Dye{Ys{x.  Steep,

In the Middle of a {bL{Bak{be{x~
The {Do{yi{Yl{Dy{x water is colder here, and a steady, westernly stream yanks you
along in that direction, or obstructs you, if trying for east.  A {Dw{ba{Bt{be{Drfall{x
lurches down the {Wc{wl{yif{wf{Ws{x on the south side, filling your ears with a noise
akin to a herd of {Wsheep{x taking turns {gv{yo{rm{yi{gt{yi{rn{yg{x, and your nose with a {rs{you{rr{x
stench to confirm the connection.  North of here, the water continues to a
solid wall of {Dst{xo{Dne{x and tainted {yw{roo{yd{x.

Near the Northern Shore~
The water here is like {ysyrup{x, thick with {ys{Du{yl{Dp{yh{Du{yr{Do{yu{Ds{x {ya{Dl{yg{Da{ye{x and slimy
plants.  Strings of {gkelp{x dance up from the bottom, licking and tickling any
bare skin swimming past.  The bottom of the lake rises dramatically
northwards, forcing those who seek to reach the northern shore to wade the
last stretch, with loose, stinking {ym{Du{yd{x up to their knees.  High cliffs halts
further advancement west and south, while the lake stretches out east of
here.

the most densely populated area of {rMa{yl{Yk{yi{rer{x.  The Seven {DT{wo{Wwe{wr{Ds{x are spread to
your west and north.  Some stand on high cliffs above lakes, others rise
freely from the overgrown {gf{Gi{ye{yl{Gd{gs{x, while one to your far northwest seems cut
straight out of the {Wmo{wu{Dnt{wa{Win{x behind it.  The ground below is filled with
fragments of stone, likely fallen, or {rb{Rl{Yast{Re{rd{x off the towers.  Little
remains of what was once a proud {Dfo{wr{Wtr{we{Dss{x of men, but wretched stumps of
stone and {Dmo{wr{Dtar{x.

An Intersection in {DB{rl{Ri{gg{Gh{Rt{re{Dd {rMa{yl{Yk{yi{rer{x~
The {Dst{xo{Dne{x fragments cluttered on the ground is on closer inspection what
remains of a {Wc{wo{Dbb{Wl{we{Dd{x road.  The road begins here and runs west, {gv{Gi{gnes{x and
various intrusive plants cover the shattered stones all but completely, and
the ground is soft and {csqu{Ci{cshy{x.  A large {Dd{yar{Dk t{yre{De{x spreads a network of
thick branches north of here, while many of small lakes are seen to the
south.  The ground rises to the east, climaxing at a boulder rising some
five feet above the ground.

Under a Tall, Twisted Tree~
A tall {Dt{yre{De{x rises just ahead, it's {Dl{we{Da{wf{D-{Wl{De{ws{Ds{x branches spreading out in
all directions, like tentacles ready to grab at anything in it's proximity. 
Surrounding {gt{Gr{ye{Ge{gs{x and bushes seems to crawl back from this menacing {Dm{ro{Dn{rst{Der
of {Db{war{Dk and {wb{Dranc{wh{x.  An intersection of paths lie south of here, while a

inevitably {Yb{yr{Deak{x, bleeding out {mpu{Mrp{mly{x sap, burning through skin like liquid

A Trail Through the {yBlight{x~
Someone walked this path quite recently, or {yp{gu{wm{Dme{wl{ge{yd{x through it.  The
ground has ruptured slightly from the abuse, and the occational tree has
toppled over away from the path.  Taunting bird-songs and lurching {Dg{rr{Do{rw{Dling{x
sounds constantly play in the dense vegetation to the east, while the ground
rises too steeply for climbing north of here.  This trail leads south on the
trail or west towards a towering tree.

So {rW{Rar{rm{x~

somewhere in the corner of your vision, yet nothing approaches.  {bL{Be{Gav{Be{bs{x flop
straight to the ground, exploding with {mdi{rseas{med{x {mju{ric{mes{x upon impact, making
your feet stick to the ground as if walking on half-dried {yale{x.  Even if no
sun can hit directly through the trees, the heat burns as if you was
standing directly at zenith in a roof-less room of mirrors.

completely unpleasant.  Tentacled {gs{ce{ga{cw{ge{ce{gd{x and bloated {man{De{mm{Do{mnes{x stick to
anything they come in contact with, and a large {Ds{yw{Ya{yr{Dm{x of flies buzz around
the shallow end.  At the temperature of newly released urine, this water
offers no shelter from the pressing {yh{Yea{yt{x above.  Shore lies north of here,
while a {ggr{yi{gmy{x rock stick up out of the water just south of here.  Tightly
packed reeds prevents passage east or west.

the south, where a wall of rock and sparse {gve{Gg{Det{ga{Gt{Dion{x blocks passage, a

The {Ds{Rerrate{Dd{x black rock ground is networked with various {rrus{yt-c{rolored{x

Nothing grows on this little island, and excepting the insects, neither does
anything live here.  {WSha{wr{Dp clif{wf{Ws{x point out from the south side, while a

significantly, and small but annoying waves threaten to shear anyone
swimming here against {Dt{wr{re{Wa{Dche{Wr{ro{w{Dus{x shoals with sharp {Ccoral{x spines.  A small

this unnatural labyrinth.  Considering how deep these waters must be, leads
to the conclusion that quite a lot of the fallen tower must be buried below.

tower built around a grated {cw{Cindo{cw{x, another large slab looks like rampart. 
{yH{Do{wr{Wn{De{yd{x little {gsl{Gi{gmy{x lizards skitter between the various hiding-places,
flicking their tongues in and out constantly.  Criss-crossing between the
fallen stone and mortar will lead a traveler north to an intersection, and

The Main Square Between the Seven Towers~
What remains of the grand plaza of the {DSe{rv{ye{Yn {Yt{yo{rw{De{Drs{x is not much.  Many
roads lead off in each direction, but most are swallowed whole by the
{gg{Gl{yutton{go{Gu{ys{x {yB{Dl{yi{Dg{yh{Dt{x.  As often before in Malkier, wrecked skeletons are spread
out on the ground among failing armor and {Db{wl{Wa{wc{Dkened {Wl{wa{Dnces{x.  Looking west
one would see a very strange and {rw{Ril{rd{x {cg{Ca{Gr{gd{Ce{cn{x, before many {DT{wo{Wwe{wr{Ds{x spread out
across the south- and northwest.  North leads to a {Bma{bri{Bna{x of sorts, while

The path is line with perversions not quite passing for trees, though these

constantly.  An {go{Gv{gergro{Gw{gn{x square lies to the west of here, while this path

large foyer.  {yS{wp{Wl{wi{Dn{wt{We{wr{ys{x of broken door and furniture lie mixed with torn
{Yt{ya{rp{ye{Ys{yt{yr{ri{ye{Ys{x and rugs.  Two huge {wm{Wa{wr{Db{wl{We{x pillars have somehow managed to stay
decently vertical by crashing into eachother, while many others along the
main way east have shattered against the floor.  The tower is very well lit
from the many holes in it's walls, not to mention, it's been broken nearly
in half and lacks a ceiling.  Large, {Dblac{yk{Dened{x doors north and south barely
remain on their hinges.  There is little of value here, if there ever was,
this tower is a solid stone structure, not built for comfort.

ventures.  The stairwell is completely filled with mixed scrap and there is
no way to climb it.  A maze of rubble leads south and west, and it appears
there are hallways on both sides of the stairwell.  High above, the open {Bsky{x

Before the Caved in Hallway~
A {Dma{ws{Ws{wi{Dve{x wall of assorted materials block any attempts east of here,
even if teh tower itself does continue quite a bit further that way.  North
of here is an equally tall pile of {Rc{xru{Ys{whe{Rd{x stone, though a tunnel wide
enough for a large man to crawl through can be seen some six feet up. 
Looking further up, one would notice only open sky, where was once a proud
{Df{wo{Drtre{ws{Ds{x.

A Silent Hallway~
A thick layer of {Ddu{ws{Dt{x covers all the floor, rising to create a {Wcha{wlk-{Wdry{x
air as it is kicked up from the feet of it's first visitors in a long time. 
The crashed pillar that must once have been the main stairwell is located
straight north of here, sometimes dropping little {Dpe{wbb{Dles{x with a noise that
might not be very powerful, but in comparison to the eerie silence of this
place is {Rd{we{Yafeni{wn{Rg{x.  Some strands of {gi{Gv{gy{x has managed to perforate the outer
wall near it's base, and runs along the south of the room.  Beneath the
dust, the floor is of smooth stone, except for a strangely symmetric network
of narrow {Wc{wr{Da{wc{Wk{Ds{x forming a square on the floor.

{bCr{mawli{bng{x {bc{gr{Geepe{gr{bs {xcurl {gc{Gr{ho{yo{gk{Ge{gd{yl{gy{x on the ground, giving off {mf{Mlesh{my{x sounds

on the east side of the path.  The trail is fairly wide, allowing for a
larger party to pass through without any advanced maneuvers.  To the north,
two circular {Ds{wt{Wr{wuct{Du{wr{We{ws{x poke up, shaded {Dblack{x from this perspective.

A {Dsneaking{x {Wsensation{x of deep deep trouble, {Gs{gl{rithe{gr{Gs{x out from underneath
the growth and {xr{Du{xbble{x.  Somewhere up north right here, two shriveled spires

High upon the {Ddr{re{Daded{x lands, a once powerful {Dst{wr{Wu{wc{Dture{x now barely stands.
It's base intact, though to{Wr{xn at height, this {rgu{ya{Yr{yd{rian{x can no longer fight
the fright of {Dnight{x, of {DB{rl{Di{Rg{rh{Dt{x.  Out of spite two {DR{wa{Wv{re{wn{Ds{x perch, on a branch

continues through {rd{Ri{rs{Re{ra{Rs{re{x.

Another {bL{Bak{be{x~
The {bw{ci{Cl{bd {bw{Ba{ct{ber{Bs{x of this {Bl{ba{Bke{x seems to want to pull north, into the deeper
end, even when the water is still so shallow one has to wade through the mud
to advance.  Surprisingly empty of all life there is only {cw{ba{Bt{be{br{x and {ymud{x
here..  And the occasional torn string of {gkelp{x.  Judging from the already
strong pull north, it wouldn't be smart to go there.  The surface is white
with {Wfoam{x out there, and the distant rumble of raging water fills teh air.

strangely stamped with what appears to be deep {Dp{ra{Dw-prin{rt{Ds{x.  The tower ahead

path is slightly more open, though not by much.  A few {ys{Dp{yl{Di{yn{Dt{ye{Dr{ys{x of door
hang off {rru{ys{rty{x hinges to the west, while a complete lack of door welcomes
travelers east into another room.  The open hallway leads north into the

There's been carnage here, but little but a faded memory remain of the
stark quarters of the guards of this tower.  A thick covering of {Dd{wus{Dt{x covers
most of the floor, a few fairly recent footprints bear witness of an
intrusion to the dedly quiet here.  Various vicious plants have {yw{Di{wt{Whe{wr{De{yd{x and
died around the cracked walls, proving that even the corrupted Blight cannot
infest what is already {Wdead{x.

The once {Drigid{x stone walls have all but withered away, peeking out shows
the intrusive jungle probably partly responsible for the decline of this
structure.  {yV{Yines{x and cr{ge{ye{gp{xers have long gnawed through the foundations and
are now criss-crossing the dust-covered floor.  Little bugs with warning
colors live out their odd lives among the writhing vegetation below, almost
looking like travelers passing many high roads as they carry various things
along the vines and out into the {gj{Gu{rng{Gl{ge{x.  The collapsed ceiling and outer
walls provide a good view of the skies above.

fallen relic of past bravery, cluttered with broken {yfurnishings{x, {rt{ya{Yt{Dt{we{Wr{ye{rd{x
wall-hangings and slabs of stone.  There are {Wbones{x here, and the dust isn't
nearly as heavy as in many of the other rooms, bearing witness to recent
activity.  Tracks burned into the stone floor of the room leads north.

broken about thirty feet above ground.  Mostly co{Dl{xl{Wa{Rp{Ws{xe{Dd{x inward, it appears,
from the lack of r{Du{xbble around.  A path leads south of here, along a plateau
between a lake and densely packed {gt{yr{ge{ye{gs{x.  Another {Dt{wo{Ww{we{Dr{x, at least twice as
tall the cracked one at the eastern side of the turn in the path, rises
straight to the west out of a small elevation in the landscape.

Guttural growling can be heard and it's just nasty as burned manure here.  A
smell of {ys{Yu{yl{Yp{yh{Yu{yr{x hangs heavy in the dusty air and the only omniscent light
in the room comes from the south.  The stairwell centering the room is
completely collapsed and blocks any attempts at moving upward.

A Creepy Dwelling~
This room is being used as home by some fell {Dcr{re{Rat{ru{Dres{x.  Fallen pillars
create high obstacles forcing the explorer to jump and climb to make any
kind of progress through this mess.  If anyone would want that.  Light knows
what may lie in {Dambush{x behind the fallen pillars but it sure is messy.  The
{rs{Rwee{rt {xsmell of {Rb{rl{Ro{ro{Rd{x and {re{Rn{rt{Rr{ra{ri{Rl{rs{x fills the room and seems to heighten the
already offensive heat further.  It's hard to breathe for a human in here.

A Path Between {BW{Cate{Br{x and {gV{ye{Gg{Ye{gg{ya{Gt{Yi{go{yn{x~
The path is soft, {gs{Gq{yuis{Gh{gy{x, and crawling with vegetation of varying
foulness.  East of here, some densely packed trees create a natural wall,
preventing passage down the slope into one of the {Bl{Cake{Bs{x.  {WW{whit{We{x, broad
mushrooms coughs out {Ym{yu{gc{gu{Gs{x and {Ysu{yl{Yphur{yo{Yus{x smoke when stepped on, adding
further displeasure to the already undesirable air.  Into the denser wood to
the west, parts of withered {Dr{wu{ri{Rn{ws{x peek out, mostly covered by mossy minions
of the {DT{ra{Di{rn{Dt{x.  A wildly writhing {Gg{ya{Yr{md{Re{Wn{x stirs south of here, full of
snake-like {gg{yr{ga{ys{gs{x.  Two taller ruins lie further up north on this path.

mostly concealed by thick vegetation, some of the {Wwhite{x, raging water can be

cluttering the {rwo{Du{rn{Dd{red{x ground you tread.

The {Wcr{wa{Dc{xked wall of the tower north is bound down by a {gn{ye{rt{yw{go{Gr{gk{x of
strangling vines.  The tightly pressing {yt{ge{yn{gd{yr{Yi{yl{gs{x of the {DB{rl{Di{rg{Dht{x intrudes
tightly from the south, forcing any traveler to walk close against the wall
in order to make any progress west at all.  A small, {Ddark{x opening has been
smashed through the wall rounding the tower a little further west.  Another
tower lies straight east of here.

A Way Inside~
Did that branch just move?  Best move inside, or anywhere away from right
here at any rate.  A {Dhole{x large enough to pass through has been punched
through the tower wall, making for a decent entrance, where no natural
exist.  The tower holds the same {Ddar{xk{W-g{wr{De{xy exterior color as the rest of the
{rMa{yl{Yki{ye{rri{x structures do.  It's rugged beauty can be appreciated even in this
wretched state.  Another tower can be reached by pressing close against the
wall to pass the sharply scratching {Db{yr{Da{yn{Dc{yh{De{ys{x east of here.

more like walking through a short tunnel.  Some type of horned {yrodents{x

unto a collapsed stairwell.  The way out lies south of here.

Calling this a room is a bit of an overstatement.  It's more of a space
filled with junk.  The floor is about three feet higher than it might have
originally been due to the collapsed {Dw{wa{Wl{wl{Ds{x north and west of here.  To the
north, a spacious, high-ceilinged room with more broken furniture than stone
lies.  East of here is another wide space.

On the Partially Pulverized Parapet~
The damage to the fortifications here aren't as bad as you can see they
are further down the wall.  More bones litter the ground here than anywhere
else in the tower.  It seems as if this was the site of a last stand.

A boulder or two can be seen where it knocked through the defenses and
opened holes for the attackers to get through.  The top of a broken ladder
still remains, hooked over the ledge.

On the Completely Pulverized Parapet~
There is nothing left of the defenses here.  There's so much rubble and
devastation that it would take a week just to find the bones of the
defenders underneath all the tons of rock.  From this location, there is a
clear view of the mostly-whole tower that is east of this one.  To the south
lies the dark pool of one of the famous Thousand Lakes.

The {DDark One{x's {DO{rr{Dc{rh{Da{rr{Dd{x~
The {gg{yr{ga{ys{gs{x grows tall here, hiding the devious ground and the many deep
{ypu{Yddl{yes{x of {gf{De{yt{Di{gd{x {ybrown {yw{Yate{yr{x.  A gargling sound follows each footstep as
boots sink into the {yp{Dorou{ys{x mud under the grass.  {gL{Ge{ya{Gf{gy{x trees rise
irregularly, each holding out {yf{Yr{yu{Di{yt{Ys{x nastier than the other.  Knobby {yf{Yu{yngi{x,
two fists large, and filled with {rs{Rt{Ci{Rc{rky red {gs{rl{ri{rm{ge{x bursts violently when
touched, splashing their {ri{Rn{rn{Ra{Yr{Rd{rs{x in wide circles.  {DR{ra{Dv{re{Dns{x are perched upon
the fruit-trees, screeching haughtily at each other.  The strange garden
stretches north, while the ground rises slightly into a cobbl{Des{xtone road
west.

A Blighted Path Between {gH{yill{gs{x and {DT{wo{Wwe{wr{Ds{x~
The ever-shifting vegetation of the {DG{rr{Dea{rt{D B{rl{Di{rg{Dht{x rise in {gover{Dg{wr{Wo{ww{Dn{x ridges
on the north and south sides of this path running from east to west.  The
ground is covered with co{Dbbl{we{Ws{wtones, mostly broken and cluttered about. 
Proud, tall {Dstr{wu{Wct{wu{Dres{x that can only be the {rSe{yv{Yen To{yw{rers{x rise on all sides
but the south, one draws near to the west, while others are all too far away
to fairly judge the true distance to their bases.  A particularly nasty
smell of {yd{Ye{ycay{x and {rd{Re{rath{x nearly colors the very air {ybrown{x with it's
sulphurous {yf{Yum{yes{x east of here.  The regular rot west is highly preferable to
even the steadiest of noses.

A tall {gb{Dr{won{Dz{re{x statue of a warrior with a commanding expression has fallen
across the path.  Variations of {gvi{cn{Ge{gs{x and {gi{Gv{gy{x cover all but his angular
face, a face that seems strangely sad.  Perhaps it is just from buckles
attained at the time of his fall, though.  The path goes from east to west,
lined with densely vegetated {gr{Gi{Ddg{Ge{gs{x on both the north and south sides.  A
short distance west of here, the dark {Wo{Du{wtli{Dn{We{x of a tall structure rises.

Below a Stone Tower~
The road west ends abruptly at a steep drop into a {cl{Cak{ce{x some thirty feet
below.  Great, {rir{Do{xn{W-{xs{Dh{rod{x double doors make up the entrance to what is left
of a tall {Dt{wo{Ww{we{Dr{x south of here.  Seeming externally well-preserved up until
two floors height, the {Dst{xo{Dne{x stru{wc{Wt{wu{Dre{x has been broken off neatly.  Craggy
remains of a staircase is all that is left higher than that, shooting upward
a few floors further.  A road of ruptured stone leads east of here, toward
the center of the {Dr{ru{Ri{rn{Ds{x, while {Dda{wr{Wkn{we{Dss{x peer out from a tunnel punching
straight through the {gj{Gu{gn{cg{Gl{ge{x wall north.

A Surprisingly Well-Kept Entry Hall~
How the devastation has missed this part of the tower is beyond you. 
Finely crafted braziers line the doors and a well-crafted carpet of an
ancient design runs from the doors to further in the tower.  The air in
here, while not the best you have smelled, is definitely not reminiscent of
the rest of Malkier.  It's as if part of Malkier still lives in this tower.

Just like the entry hall, it looks like the rest of the first floor is in
as good of shape.  The red carpet continues into this room and runs to the
east and west, following the wall of the tower.  The stones that tile the
floor look to be ancient as well, lending to the majesty that was Malkier.

A Walk Through Past Glories~
Gr The carpet here changes to a different hue than the one running around
the tower to the west and north it is a deep golden.  The wall hangings also
change to battles that Malkier has participated in and won.  According to
the hangings, until the attack by the Shadowspawn, Malkier was a powerful
fighting force.

The golden carpet continues to this part of the tower, and the wall
hangings of the glories of Malkier continue.  Strangely, the last hanging
looks newer than all the rest.  It shows a lone Malkieri man looking down on
the last King and Queen of Malkier with a raised trolloc blade in his hand.

Chairs and tables still sit where they were decades ago.  A rack of
neatly organized spears and swords sits against the north wall, and next to
it several suits of armor are neatly stacked where they were left.  Unlike
the other towers, these pieces of equipment look to be oiled, sharpened, and
well-kept.

heavy bludgeoning weapon was used to attempt to destroy them.  The only wall
remaining on the top floor lies to the south of here, blocking any view, and
even that seems to be about to topple.

your feet.  A constant, {yp{ru{yt{rr{yi{rd{w gale bites into both nostrils and clothing,
tossing both your stomach and the tower from side to side.  

Looking north, more towers can be sighted as well as a network of lakes
{bo{go{yzi{gn{bg{w sickly with oily waters.  The {gj{Gu{Rn{rg{Gl{ge{w to the east and west stand in
sharp contrast to the ominous mountains to the north.  Remains of a wall at

buzzing around everything.  The ground consists mostly of bent and broken
little {gt{ywig{gs{x and the occational rock.  The strange lighting of the path
casts {Dlo{xo{Wm{xi{Dng{x shadows all around.  Some can't be possibly be human.  Maybe
they are simply {gs{Dhade{gs{x of leaves rustling in the wind.  Yet there is no wind

A wall of {gf{Gl{re{rs{Gh{gy{x leaves has overtaken the main road on the east side,
while the road continues through the groping trees west.  Something has
cleared a path straight through the {gf{yr{go{yn{gd{ye{gs{yc{ge{yn{gc{ye{x southward.  How far it
leads is impossible to tell from this point, the tunnel is too long and
dark, illuminated only by irregular eye-like specks of {Glum{gi{Gn{go{Gus {gg{Gree{gn{x.  It
does cut through the jungle in an angle that would, if it is indeed long
enough, take a traveler to a tall tower of {Dst{xo{Dne{x.

enough for two men to tread, shoulder to shoulder.  The road does widen west
of here, but remains unchanged eastward.  On the north and south sides, the
ground rise slightly and thickens with {rcu{br{rdled{x vegetation.  The sensation of
being watched is constant, radiating from both the {bsk{wi{We{bs{x and {Bj{bu{Gn{gg{rl{ge{x.  A
single, fra{Dc{wt{Wu{wred silhouette emerge out of the trees westerly.  To the south

and even further is another half-razed tower.  The ground is of tightly

nearly all the way to the revolting {gg{Gr{you{Gn{gd{x, and only a skeletal stairway off

other angles lack any kind of {Dre{wi{Wn{wf{Dorc{we{Wm{we{Dnt{x.  Some of the rubble around you
must be from the support-beams that does not remain in their places.

feel that the rubble is very loose and ready to break free and collapse to
the ground.

floor is {gw{Ge{gt{x and {cslimy{x, {bl{Di{bv{Di{bd{x plants with {mpurple{x thorns have broken through
the foundation, seemingly eating away at the {Dst{wo{Dne{x floor.  Looking over the
little that remains of the wall one would see a sloping hill down toward a
{Dsm{be{Dary{x {Bb{blu{Be{x {clake{x.

On the Main Road Between the {DT{wo{Wwe{wr{Ds{x~
The old main road leads north toward a densely {gv{Ge{gg{be{Dt{ba{gt{Ge{gd{x intersection, or
south, where a small overgrown square at the front of a huge p{Di{wle of ru{Wb{wb{Dl{xe,
with a tall staircase poking out of it can be seen.  Further up north,
through the {gj{gu{Dngle{G-{Dro{Ga{gd{x, more {Dr{xu{ri{Rn{xs appear.  One which seems more
fortress-like than the others.

Intersecting Trails Between the {DSe{rv{ye{Yn T{do{rw{Ders{x~
The main road intersects with a side-path east, leading along the south
side of a stony hill {gc{br{ma{rw{Rl{mi{bn{gg{x with sickening {gv{Gi{gnes{x toward the {Dde{dn{Dsely{x packed
{gj{Gu{bng{Gl{ge{x.  The air is so damp and {yw{Yar{ym{x, cough reflexes would spawn with each
breath.  {DT{wo{Wwe{wr{Ds{x lie in all directions from here, a fortress-like one up
north and to the west across an overgrown {ymoat{x and over a {Ddr{ya{Ywbr{yi{Ddge{x.

South of a {DSt{wo{Dny{x Hill~
A tall {gh{Gi{Dl{Gl{x with the {Dst{xo{Dny{x ruins of a large building, suffocated under a
cover of one thousand {yr{Do{xg{Du{xe plants of abundant {rfou{rl{rness{x, block passage
north.  Dying {gtr{ye{ges{x, huddled together tightly, in what could be {Wterror{x have
their branches tied and twisted into each other with ropes of thick vines,
effectively blocking advancement south.  The options of travel are, with
these parameters, either east toward a small clearing, or west for the
cr{Da{wcked main cobblestone-road.

Fallen {rLa{yn{Yc{ye{rrs{x~
Tangled {Dv{yin{Des{x warp around bloated, dying {Dt{yr{Dees{x that seep {Yin{Wf{De{yctio{Yn{x,
creating a mess that is completely impassible to the east.  Above this
encroachment of the Blight, ruins of silhouetted, crumbling {Dt{wo{Ww{we{Drs{x stand
against the {rre{Rddeni{rng{x sky.  The color of the horizon matches the ground,
still stained with the crimson {Rblood{x of only a few of Malkier's last
fighters.  {WSkeletons{x mare the harsh, dry ground, twisted in agony, as if
their final moments will last forever.  Some are arched painfully across
boulders on the ground, others are scattered through the {yd{Dus{yt{x.  The sizes of
the bones vary so greatly, that putting the remains together would be
impossible.  Some of the larger bones, perhaps leg bones, are so alarmingly
small that they must have belonged to children.  Remnants of scarce {yle{Da{yther{x
armor and makeshift weapons, even a blacksmith's {Dha{wmm{Der{x, lie on the ground,
rotting and turning into {yd{Dus{yt{x.

What remains of this {Ds{wt{Wre{xe{Dt{x is not much except skeletal fra{Dg{wments of
cob{Wbl{westone and a host of intruding {bp{Bl{ca{Bn{bts{x and {mfl{Mo{Yw{Me{mrs{x.  A tall hill rises
east of here, with the {Dr{ru{Ri{Dn{x of a large building squinting out from it's
cover of {Dd{ra{Dr{rk{Dne{rs{Ds{x.  Several other destroyed buildings stick out of the
ground here and there like {Wgr{wav{Dest{won{Wes{x of the fallen {rCa{yp{Yi{yt{ral{x.  Vines
constantly try to {gc{Go{gil{x around the feet of the unwary, as if they were
equipped with a {Ddark{x conscience.

part of {DS{rev{ye{Yn T{yo{rwe{Drs{x, where the famed network of {Bl{bake{Bs{x used to {cm{Cirro{cr{x the
beautiful and pure sky in the days of old.  The {Yheat{x has gotten less
pleasant with every step north and deeper into the {DB{rl{Dight{x, and the {Rstench{x
more intrusive.  A {Dr{wigi{Dd {Df{wo{Wr{wt{Dress{x of a tower remain at least two stories
tall west of here, through a narrow trail, across a dry moat and up over
it's fallen {ydra{Ywb{yridge{x.  The path also runs east along the north side of a
crawling hill.

A Narrow Path Littered with {DSt{won{Des{x and {WB{wo{Dnes{x~
The {rMa{yl{Yk{yi{reri{x legacy of {cbr{Ca{Wv{Ce{cry{x and {bh{Bo{Wn{Bo{br{x to the last dying breath, is
spread out on the ground.  Skeletons of many felled warriors are slowly
eaten away by the rot.  A well-kept sk{We{wl{De{wt{Wo{xn draws more attention than
others.  It lies decapitated on the ground, with a much smaller skeleton of
a {Wchild{x at one shoulder, and a {rr{yust{ry {ra{yx{re{x at the other.  The hateful jungle
reaches out from the east, while a {Dst{wo{Dny{x hill rises from the south. 
Straight north this road leads, up to an imploded tower, not higher than the
hill south.  Heading west takes the traveler back to a small intersection.

{DDark {Ws{wmoke b{Wi{wl{Dl{xow up from the crumpled tower ahead, and a stomach-turning
smell of {ydroppings{x and {rb{Ru{yr{Rn{rt {Rflesh{x fills the air.  Other than the crushed
hill of a tower ahead, and the throbbing {gj{Gu{gn{yg{gl{Ge{x around, there is little
here.  Fragments of bone is mixed with cracked cobblestone and larger
boulders on the ground.

{yc{Do{yr{Dr{yu{Dp{yt{Di{yo{yn{x below while few stand tall, still pushing just a little bit of
the {DB{rl{Di{rg{Dht{x off the main roads of their creators.  The high, {Gm{go{Gs{gs{Gy{x ground has
swallowed {Dro{wc{Dks{x whole, making the trail precarious and uneven.  {rEvil{x {gj{Gu{gn{yg{gl{Ge{x

south sides.  The thickening B{rl{xi{rg{xht seems to draw retreat a little further
west, as the entrance of a {Dthi{wc{Wk to{ww{Der{x looms over it's broken {ydraw{Ybr{yidge{x and
dried up {ym{Yo{yat{x.  Also to the east does the path get lighter, widening to an

Through the Dry Moat~
Strange, {yb{Wa{ym{Wb{yoo{y-{Wl{yike{x {Bb{blu{be{x reeds have sprung from the {ydry{x, caked {ym{Du{yd{x of
the moat.  Chopping one's way forward toward what remains of the drawbridge
seems the easiest way to make one's way.  The reeds are extremely tough,
however, and normally they will only fold sideways momentarily if struck
hard.  To actually sever one, you would need to grab hold of the top and {Ds{Wa{Dw{x
the {rb{Rl{ro{Ro{rdy{x thing off.  The wall of the moat is climbable to the east of
here, and also to the north, while one will have to crawl up the collapsed
{ydraw{Ybr{yidge{x slumped diagonally into the mud from the front gate of the tower
westward.

This trail leads north into the deeper {DB{rl{Di{rg{Dht{x, toward the Mounta{Wi{wn{Ds of

of diseased trees and heavy footsteps.

A Narrow Path Through the Dark {gJ{Gu{gn{yg{gl{Ge{x~
Strange, tall {yt{gr{ye{ge{ys{x filter most of {Wlight{x of the sky away, leaving the
narrow path in darkness.  Not the {Dpitc{xh{W-{xb{Dlack{x darkness of a s{Wt{xa{Wr{xl{We{xs{Ws{x night
at sea, rather a kind of {Dfor{rebo{Dding{x gloom.  The dense vegetation and tall
trees all have a kind of brownish green blackness to them as a cause to the
murky air.  The small path is cluttered with a few remaining fragments of
c{Wo{wb{Dble{ws{Wt{wone, and hard lumps under the {gm{Go{Cs{Gs{gy{x ground hint of more hidden
beneath the undergrowth.  The path leads north and south.

A long, worming path leads through the dark, damp jungle and southward
where a number of {ws{Wk{wel{De{wtal {Dt{wo{Wwe{wr{Ds{x poke out of the trees in the distance. 
The air reeks of the rotting {Dd{reat{Dh{x common in the {DB{rl{Di{rg{Dht{x.  Sick, sickening
{gt{yr{ge{ye{gs{x line the path, accompanied by lower bushes sporting stickily {mbu{Mr{Ys{rt{Yi{Mn{mg{x
berries.  {gS{Gl{gimy{x, ropy {gv{Gi{bn{ges{x intertwine between trees, forcing anyone
traveling the path to constantly duck or leap, to avoid their rancid
residues.  Many sounds echo through the Blight jungle, and none of them
would make anything but a monster feel welcome.

Over the {ySpl{Yint{yered {xDrawbridge~
A collapsed drawbridge leading straight up to the gaping entrance of the
tower west of here lies pinned diagonally into the moat, creating a steeply
rising {yga{Yn{ygway{x.  The {Dma{wss{Dive{x tower ruin, shadowing this side of the
reed-filled moat rises two tall stories up, with another four or so sm{Ra{Ys{Rh{xed
and spread across the surrounding areas, and doubtlessly into the interior
of the tower as well.  Many small archery-balconies with low {Dp{warapet{Ds{x are
masoned to the outer walls facing all sides, seemingly even more prevalent
on the side facing the drawbridge.

The entire entrance to this tower is ruined.  The door lies on the floor
where it was torn and thrown, the carpet has been slashed, and any furniture

fierce than anywhere else in the city.

Even more bones lay on the floor here.  Hundreds must have died in the
first thirty feet of the tower, trying to defend their King and Queen.  The
most noticeable feature is the fluff of fabric that used to be the carpet. 
No more than a few inches are left together at any point.  You can only
guess what could have done this.

At the End of the Tunnel~
The {btu{Bn{bnel{x widens in what must have once been the highest room of the
tower, rotting remains of what at some point was floor is easily passed to
gain entrance.  The water has retreated going deeper into the tunnel, and
now only reaches two feet, it's very {cc{Col{cd{x down here, perhaps a comfortable
change from the glaring heat above.  Part of the floor appears to be
reinforced {yw{Yoo{yd{x and not stone, why it has not rotted is uncertain.

A Well-Kept Storage Room~
This room is completely preserved, if it weren't for the {Bw{bate{Br{x {csp{Clas{ched{x
in when the door above was opened.  Better close it.  Having a look around
you see various animal heads nailed to the {yp{ra{yn{re{yl{re{yd{x walls, what wasn't {Dn{wa{Wil{we{Dd{x
down is in chaos from the trauma this tower once went through.

{BSlowly the pressure eases, you must be heading upwards.  The water is
dark and murky, but the worst of the current has let you go from it's grip.

Ascending the Wall-less Stairway~
The first few steps up these stairs feels {Ds{xt{Da{xble, the steps are {Ddar{xk{Dened{x
and beaten from the constant abuse of {cw{Ce{ca{gt{Gh{ge{cr{x.  {DSt{wo{Dne{x is still {Dst{xo{Dne{x,
however, even the {yB{rl{yi{rg{yh{rt{x cannot change that, and these stones are holding. 
The outer walls supporting the stairs does not rise further than this.  The
north route up higher is precariously narrow and without any type of
railings.

Ascending the Wall-less Stairway~
Some half-smashed steps upward demand either a leap or a climb to
proceed.  There are no railings, and large {Dch{xu{Dnks{x of the {Dst{xo{Dne{x has been
smashed off.  It is a miracle, and testiment of the {Ds{wtabilit{Dy{x this tower
must once have held, that the whole thing hasn't crashed to join it's {Dd{we{Dt{wr{Di{wc{x
brethren below.

On the Dwindling Stairway~
A {cg{Dus{ct{x of {cw{Cin{cd{x flies in from the north, threatening to knock the light of
weight off their feet.  The constantly climbing stairway leads east toward
another sharper turn up.  The view improves further the higher these stairs
are climbed, and most of The Seven Towers area can already be seen.  Far
down below to the north, {Ws{wm{xok{We{x rises from a completely collapsed tower.

A Narrow Ledge~
The drop down increases with each step up, here a narrow ledge gives a
little extra room to move north of the steps upward.  Perhaps this was once
the entrance to another floor, or balcony.  Some {rc{wl{We{wan-picked {wb{yo{wn{Wes{x of what
might be rabbit, and might be something entirely different but rabbit-sized
grin up at you from the floor.

On the Dwindling Stairway~
The gale increases the further up you manage to get, the ground is more
than a mortal drop below, the air is a bit {Wfresher{x and {Ccooler{x up here.  A
large {ynest{x of gathered {yt{Dw{yi{Dg{ys{x blocks passage further up, angry {Ds{rq{Du{ra{Dwks{x coming
from within warns of {Dt{re{Dn{ra{Dnts{x displeased at this intrusion in their secluded
home.  The stairs upward continue south, while the road down and west leads
back to the solid ground.

Climbing Higher~
The {Dst{wa{Dir{x continues to screw upward.  Vacillating slightly in the wind. 
The climb becomes more precarious with each step upward.  Not too much
further up it abruptly reaches it's end with a jagged little balcony
overlooking the lakes of {rSev{ye{Yn T{yo{rwers{x.

At the Top of the Stairway~
The climb will take you no further than this, as the {Dst{xa{Dir{x flattens out
into a little plateau stretching west of here.  Some few bits of {Wpa{wrape{Dt{x
remain, though most is lying on the ground 50 feet below.  Good thing the
weather is {cc{Cl{We{Ca{cr{x here, this must be the highest point for several leagues in
all directions, and very likely attracts some {Yl{wi{Wg{wh{Wtn{wi{Wn{yg{x.

A Secret Garden~
A garden of what used to be unsurpassed beauty lies outside of the tower.
It must have been a secret place for the King and Queen to disappear to when
they wanted to be alone.  Now it has gone into disrepair and weeds have
grown up to choke the life of any beauty that used to grow here.

Treasure fills the floor of this room, some in chests, and other just on
shelves or desks.  Not surprisingly, it has been left alone, seeing as how
the complex and garden above are untouched.  The walls shine with the amount

This room is well fortified.  Any damage that was done to it has been
repaired.  In the corner is a makeshift bed that has mounds of cloth on it
for padding or a blanket.  A hastily constructed cabinet sits next to the
bed.  A rack of sharp, but rotting weapons stands against one of the wall,
most stained multiple times with blood.

and a few smallish tentacles stick up out of it's {mi{Mr{mi{bd{Bi{bs{rc{ge{cn{gt{D surface.

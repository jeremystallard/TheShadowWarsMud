dark haired man~
a dark {yha{Dir{yed{x man named John Xenir~
A dark {yha{Dir{yed{x man wanders the inn greeting patrons.
~
Tall and lean this man be, with dark {yh{Dai{yr{x and piercing {bb{Blu{be{x eyes the
color of the sea.  His frame is lean and lithe but there is no doubt this
man can handle himself in any situation.  His clothing is that of the local
people, a full-sleeved {bblue{x shirt is tucked into a pair of {Dblack{x baggy
trousers, while on his feet he wears a pair of sturdy {Dblack{x boots.  Over all
he wears a knee-length vest made of {ysh{Weepsk{yin{x, the {Wwooly{x part turned in to
keep him warm.  A {ybelt{x encircles his waist, its sole purpose to hold the
{Dsheath{x to his slender sword.

bouncer hefty~
a {Dhefty{x bouncer named Sam~
A {Dhefty{x bouncer named Sam guards the main entrance to the room.
~
Large, gigantic, huge, all good words that would describe this hulk of a
man well.  Standing at well over 6' and with muscles to match, Sam is
defiantely a force to be reckoned with.  His {Dblack{x hair has been cut very
short so that his {Dpie{wrc{Ding{x gaze has no obstruction, his {Dg{wre{Dy{x eyes hold much
more intelligence then one might expect of hired muscle.  His clothing is of
the local people, a full-sleeved {Wwhite{x shirt is tucked into a pair of {Dblack{x
baggy trousers matched up with a pair of sturdy {Dblack{x boots and a
knee-length {ysh{Weepsk{yin{x vest over all.

huge burly bouncer~
a huge and burly bouncer~
A huge and {Dburly{x bouncer named Max guards the entrance to the private room.
~
This man easily dwarfs the other two bouncers present at the inn, his
height is easily over 6'5" and his huge frame easily fills up the entire
door way to the private gambling room.  His hair is non-existant, having
been shaved completely off but judging by his bushy {rred{x eyebrows one can
only assume his hair color was the same.  From beneath the bushy brows one
can see a pair of dark {ybrown{x eyes watching all within the room carefully and
whenever someone argues too loudly his gaze flicks over to the offending
person.  His clothing is of the local people, a full-sleeved {Wwhite{x shirt is
tucked into a pair of {Dblack{x baggy trousers matched up with a pair of sturdy
{Dblack{x boots and a knee-length {ysh{Weepsk{yin{x vest over all, one gets the feeling
a lot of sheep were killed for that vest.

large bouncer~
a large bouncer named Tom~
A large bouncer named Tom keeps an eye on the patrons.
~
Reaching a height of 6'2" this large man keeps an eye on all that goes on
in the common room.  His {ybrown{x hair has been cropped short to keep clear of
his {ggreen{x eyes, showing clearly a square jaw and thickly muscled neck.  His
clothing is of the local people, a full-sleeved {Wwhite{x shirt is tucked into a
pair of {Dblack{x baggy trousers matched up with a pair of sturdy {Dblack{x boots
and a knee-length {ysh{Weepsk{yin{x vest over all.  He carries no weapons but
considering his size and the way the patrons behave its easy to say he
handles himself quite well.

This eccentricly dressed pirate walks with a stumbling gait, his hands
help up in an odod gesture as he goes.  Long {ybrown{x hair formed into
dreadlocks is held down with a {Rr{re{Rd{x bandana on his head along with a {Dblack{x
hat.  His face is slightly gaunt looking, his thin {ylong{x beard that is neatly
trimmed and twisted down from his chin only heightens this look.  His
piercing {ybrown{x eyes hold a shimmer of amusement but also a deadly gleam.
Secured on his belt is a curved cutlass.

His wavy, shoulder length {ybrown{x hair is tied back against the nape of his

him from a slender yet handsome face.  He is dressed rather plainly in an
off {Wwh{Di{Wte{x shirt and a pair of {ybrown{x breeches.  Sheathed at his hip is a
sword that looks to be of fine quality, almost looks out of place except
that he seems quite confident in its use.

Sensual beauty gracess this young woman in all aspects.  Her long, wavy
{ybrown{x hair cascades down her back and over her shoulders, framing a delicate
face with bright {ybrown{x eyes and full {rpouty{x lips.  Her body is curvy and
slender, a fact which is accentuated by her clothes, or lack thereof.  Her
clothing consists of her {Wnightgown{x and nothing else aside from a pair of
{Dslippers{x on her feet.  Why she is sailing around in her nighty is hard to
guess but the rest of the crew don't seem to mind.

This grotesque {Ddonkey{x looks like it has seen better days.  Its left ear

and is all growing in patches like someone took a razor too him in places
but didn't do all of his coat.  His tail is completely missing, not even a
little stub has been left behind.  One can't help but pity this beast as he
plods along after his master.

Although of medium size for a horse this stallion makes up for it in
muscle and the desire to please.  He easily keeps the pace set to him by his
rider or those around him and is also as content pulling plows or wagons. 
His multi-colored coat is kept at a nice healthy sheen and he is attentive
and alert to what is going on around him.

Nostrils flaring, {Ceyes{x wide, {Dhooves{x stamping the ground, {rmane{x tossing

screams untameable with her every defiant movement and yet somehow her owner
has command of her, guiding her with a firm hand.  Though built more for
speed she seems up to a good fight.

A Crossroads~
Meeting and somehow blending together the {ydirt{x road from the south
mingles into the {Dco{wbb{Wles{wto{Dne{x roads that spread out in either direction.  The
cliffs that begin to form and flow upwards along the south road stretches
out along the eastern and western roads as well, acting like a buffer
between the town and the ocean.  All the buildings that start at the corners
of the roads and spread out have the typical {Dslate{x roofs and dark {Dst{wo{Dne{x
walls.

The Main Road~
The main road continues along south from the center of Falme, the
cobblestones extending in both directions.  On the western side of the road
a building made of stone sits.  Much like the inn further north there is an
{We{by{We{x above the door but along side the {We{by{We{x is the image of a set of {bwaves{x. 
The only window is on the right side of the building and inside a figure can
be seen sitting behind a desk with chairs all about the room.  Other
buildings sit on either side of the road, all with the same {Dslate{x roofs that
can be found throughout the village.

Center of Town~
The center of the large town is in constant motion, day or night, as the
general populace and visitors move from place to place.  Sailors often
swagger through on their way to one of the stores, Domani merchants
gracefully make their way through the crowd as they go about their business.
In the middle of the square is a medium sized well, one big enough that two
or more people can fetch water at the same time as the water comes almost
flush to the top of the grey blocks that make up the portion of the well
seen above the ground.  The road here is made of cobblestones, like the rest
of the roads in town, and extends in either direction.

The Main Road~
The main road continues north from the center of the town and is lined by
houses on either side.  To one side of this section of the road though is a
large building with a sign hanging above its door of an {We{by{We{x and beneath the
eye in letters are the words {DTh{we W{Wat{wch{Der{x.  Large bay windows on either side
of the sturdy wood door allow passersby to see into the foyer of the inn. 
The atmosphere inside seems warm and welcoming and many travelers stop here
to rest themselves before continuing on wether by foot, horse or by ship. 
Perhaps a quick drink is in order before you continue on your journey.

The Main Road~
The wide {Dco{wbb{Wles{wto{Dne{x road that splits the town cleanly down the middle is
able to traffic people in either direction with ease and is wide enough to
let two wagons pass each other if needed.  People come and go all day long
as they run errands, heading for the various stores that populate the road. 
{WW{cin{Cd{co{Wws{x and {Wlan{wte{Wrns{x provide welcome breaks against the stark {Dst{wo{Dne{x of the
buildings as does the occassional side road.

A Main Road into Town~
A {ydirt{x road meets the {Dco{wbb{Wles{wto{Dne{x road of the town and can be seen
snaking a path through the long grass heading away from the town.  A couple
of the Watchers are always present to keep an eye on the comings and goings
of residents and visitors alike. The familiar {Dslate{x roofs and dark {Dst{wo{Dne{x
walls of the buildings are broken apart by the road as it heads into Town.

A Winding Road~
The {Dcliff{x walls actually begin to narrow gradually in a downward slope,
revealing more sky bit by bit.  During the day the sun provides the light
but at night lanterns hang from {ywooden{x posts placed at intervals along the
road.  There are fewer birds along this stretch and the sound of the ocean
has long left the echoing walls.  The road bends once more but instead of
another turn being seen up ahead the beginning of the streets of Falme can
be seen.

There are no markings on the building at all and the only people that go in
are sailors, all men.

The {Dcliffs{x don't seem to ever end but down the road open sky can be seen
as the smell of the ocean and the sound of the waves crash through into this
section of the cliffs.  Birds fly around up above and if one looks closely
enough their nests can be seen in the rocks high above.  Not far off a {Dstone{x

The Harbor~
The {ywooden{x planks gradually end and gradually turn into {yd{Dir{yt{x, marking the
road that leads too and from the harbor into Falme.  The only building along
the first stretch through the cliffs has two signs, a pictured of a ship
with a whip across it on one and the words "{DHarbor Master{x" on the other.  A
ways down the road is seen verring suddenly, the high cliffs blocking any
view of Falme though.

Along the Docks~
Rocking with the motion of the water the {ywooden{x dock leads off in either
direction along the edge of Falme.  Jutting out from the dock are piers that
usually have at least one ship anchored at them.  The piers go far out into
the water so that the ships will have no fear of running a ground on the
rocks deep below the water.  Sailors move along the docks with their rolling
gait, not having any problems with the rocking of the docks but those that
don't spend time down here obviously are having problems walking as they
often stumble, their faces looking very green.  To the north the {ywood{x planks
turn to dirt as the road heads into Falme itself.

building shows an image of a mark and a boat.

The {ywooden{x planks that make up the dock are on sturdier ground here and
do not rock with the water as the only water beneath the wood is what washes
up with the waves.  At the end of the planks is a solid looking {ywood{x door
with a {Dmetal{x door handle, looking up the door seems to lead too a tall tower
that sits high up on top of the cliffs.

the lush {ggreen{x lawn with its {mflowers{x and the {Wstone{x pathway leading from the

and those that don't quickly learn.

directly into the stone of the cliff, slowly winding upwards to the

The Lighthouse~
The large room of the {Wligh{Dth{Wouse{x is designed to keep the elements like
the wind and rain out so that the large fire built in the center can burn
without problems.  The firepit is surrounded with glass to keep the smoke
from filling the room and up near the ceiling of the lighthouse a grate with
holes lets the smoke escape but keeps water out.  The only hole in the glass
is on the far side of the stairs, some smoke escapes from it but not enough
to make a person choke.  The room has no chairs but is instead filled with
dry wood so that whoever tends to this large fire can keep it going when it
is needed.  The walls of the room are not made with wood but instead of
metal and glass, whoever built this was far more advanced in thinking then
most people that reside in Falme.

seem louder in here then outside as if the entire stairwell echos the sound.

Top of a Watch Tower~
The view from the top of the Watch Tower is spectacular.  In one
direction miles upon miles of sparkling blue ocean is seen and in the other
is Falme and the land beyond that.  From here one can also see the harbor
far below and on the other side the large lighthouse that guides the ships
away from the rocks that would rip them asunder.  The watch tower itself is
made out of the same grey rock that forms the cliffs but has been made
smooth both by the builder and the winds that howl around the building.

A Side Road~
Along the narrower road one almost feels like the looming {Dst{wo{Dne{x buildings
are closing in despite the {Wlan{Cte{Wrns{x placed at regular intervals.  The same
{Dco{wbb{Wles{wto{Dne{x makes up the road here and when walking along here at the more
quiet times the sound of ones footsteps echos between the rows of buildings.
The buildings seem to be mostly houses but occasionally a store or pub are
tucked away amidst them, the only thing to separate them is the sign hanging
above the door.

A Cobblestone Road~
Throughout the town {Dco{wbb{Wles{wto{Dne{x is used on the roads, though the town has
no walls people are still expected to enter on the main roads leading into
it.  Looking away from the buildings long swaying {ggrass{x dotted with trees
stretches out in all directions.  All the buildings along the western side
of the road have the typical {Dslate{x roofs and dark {Dst{wo{Dne{x walls.  A small side
road heads further into town, the looming {Dst{wo{Dne{x buildings making it look
gloomy.

The Main Road~
The wide {Dco{wbb{Wles{wto{Dne{x road that splits the town cleanly down the middle is
able to traffic people in either direction with ease and is wide enough to
let two wagons pass each other if needed.  People come and go all day long
as they run errands, heading for the various stores that populate the road. 
{WW{cin{Cd{co{Wws{x and {Wlan{wte{Wrns{x provide welcome breaks against the stark {Dst{wo{Dne{x of the
buildings.

One building has a wide open set of barn doors and a sign with the symbol of
a hammer and an anvil let people know that this is the blacksmiths
workplace.  The sound of hammering can be heard constantly during the day
and during the night it is almost eerily quiet when the blacksmith isn't
working.

Fishing Supplies~
There are no windows in this shop as protection against the wind, water
and anything else that might come flying at the building.  The walls of the
shop are covered with everything from fishing rods to nets, hooks, fishing
line, boots, bait and anything and everything that has to do with fishing. 
A counter at the back of the shop also displays various items except for a
section that is kept clear so purchases can be made.  The place smells of
salt, water and fish while the sound of the ocean outside beats against its
walls.

The Main Deck~
Never is there a quiet moment on this deck for every sailor has his
duties, wether its swabbing the deck or tending to the sails this place is
one of constant motion.  Stretched out before you is almost the full length
of the ship, from the main mast to the hatch to the hold, the fore mast and
at its end the forecastle.  Just behind is the door to the Captain's
quarters and above that the Quarter deck.

The Foyer of The Watcher~
The foyer is kept cleaned, despite the number of dirty boots that tramp
across its floor on a daily basis, and well lit.  The furniture here is kept
to a minimum except for a pair of {ywooden{x benches beneath each of the large
bay windows that look out into the world.  To the south the sounds of
chatter can be heard from the common room, the place sounds full but the
atmosphere is one of joviality.  To the north the muted sounds of dice
striking wood and soft banter can be heard behind the door marked "{DGames
{DRoom{x" while to the west a hallway can be seen leading deeper into the inn.

A Cobblestone Road~
A {Dco{wbb{Wles{wto{Dne{x road cuts a path between the cliffs and the town itself
heading east and west.  The {Dcliff{x spreads out along the southern side of the
road, acting like a buffer between the town and the ocean.  All the
buildings along the northern side of the road have the typical {Dslate{x roofs
and dark {Dst{wo{Dne{x walls.  The stretch of building with its seamless wall on the
north side of the road is only broken up by a single door and a window every
few feet.

Along a Pier~
Connected to the dock the pier bobs up and down on the waves even more
then the docks themselves do.  Walking this takes practice but even during
storms it can be hard to get across as the water makes the {ywood{x planks very
slippery.  Further down the end of the pier can be seen jutting farther into
the ocean so the ships have an easier time of anchoring with no fear of
hitting rocks.

The Main Deck of the Silver Mark~
{WWhite{x sails snap in the wind, the creak of the {ywood{x as the ship rocks
back and forth with the waves.  Never is there a quiet moment on this deck
for every sailor has his duties, wether its swabbing the deck or tending to
the sails this place is one of constant motion.  Too and fro the men move,
pushing cargo down below, supplies and other necessaties of living on the
high seas.  Not far from here is the forcastle of the ship, where the crew
live, and to the rear is the quarter deck and the Captain's quarters.

The Games Room~
The games room is large and takes up the majority of the northern half of
the ground floor.  {yTables{x take up as much space as possible as well as six
{ychairs{x for each table.  Space is left between the tables enough for people
to move around them, such as the servants that carry drinks and
occassionally food to the players.  Anyone is welcome to play here, the only
requirement is that you have some sort of money on hand for this is a
gambling room, those that wish to play for fun can find a game in the common
room.  The people here are generally of good spirits though the occasional
argument does occur but there is a nice hefty bouncer standing near each set
of doors to keep them from getting out of hand.  The second bouncer near the
door heading into a different room from the foyer is guarding said door and
is also one of two people that carry a key for it.  So come and sit and play
a game or two but once you run out of money please make room for the next
person but do return when you do have some money.

A Private Games Room~
Only a select few individuals are permitted within this room, generally
those with a lot of money or who are special guests or visitors and that
have been given permission to play here.  There are only two {ytables{x with up
to six {ychairs{x at each, both are spaced an equal distance apart from both
each other and the walls.  A {ywooden{x cabinet is against one of the far walls
and beside it a servant sits waiting to serve those inside whatever drinks
they so desire. The room is generally quiet except for the occasional talk
and the sounds of either the cards or the dice as their tossed.  The smell
of tabacoo, of drink and generally of unwashed bodies seem to permeate the
room on a permanent basis.

The Common Room~
The common room is much like any other common room found in the world. 
The bustle of activity ranges from customers talking, eating and playing
games to serving wenches running around serving food and drinks. 
Occasionally there is live entertainment, normally in the form of a gleeman
or a bard, they generally play on a small platform set up infront of the
large bay window that looks outside.  Tables fill almost all four corners of
the room except along the west wall where a large bar and a door leading
into the kitchen are.  A large {rf{Rire{Yp{Rlac{re{x sits in the middle of the southern
wall and easily keeps the room warm on those cold days.  The patrons are
generally well behaved but still on hand is a large bouncer that usually is
leaning up against the wall beside the door leading into the foyer.  So come
on in, take a seat, warm your feet and fill your belly for {DTh{we W{Wat{wch{Der{x is
always open and glad to have ya.

The Kitchen~
{rH{Rea{rt{x from the ovens keeps the kitchen constantly hot, causing all that
work here to sweat constantly.  The {bs{Bmel{bl{x of the various dishes cooking and
breads being baked permiates the room causing mouths to water.  The cooks
and serving wenches move about in an almost graceful sort of dance, the
servers avoiding the cooks and the cooks expecting the servers to move as
they each go about their tasks.  The head cook supervises everything, a
ladel held in one hand as if it was a weapon but instead she uses it to stir
soups or to wave menacingly at a cook or server who isn't moving quickly
enough.  The quietest this kitchen gets is during the hours between midnight
and close to dawn when most people are sleeping, there is usually only a few
people in here cleaning, preparing dough for baking and getting things ready
for the next day.  Perhaps if you asked nicely the head cook would give you
a plate of food before she tosses you out of her kitchen screaming about
people getting in the way.

A Staircase~
The small hallway ends in a staircase leading upwards into the inn.  The
staircase is wide and can easily hold two large men side to side and seems
to require it as people are constantly going up and down them.  The noise
level only seems to increase as you go upwards and you get the feeling its
going to be crowded.

A Busy Hallway~
The hallway here is almost as busy as the common room is downstairs with
the amount of people going back and forth at times.  A varying assortment of
people spend their nights and occassionally their days as well up here on
the second floor of the inn.  There is a carpet on the floor that once looks
to have been a nice shade of {ggreen{x but now its more a {ybrownish{x {ggreen{x with
the amount of shoes that walk on it daily.  The discolored carpet extends
down all three hallways that spread out from this point.  Simple enclosed
{Wlan{Yte{Wrns{x are hung at intervals along the hallway, generally between the rows
of doors.

The hallway continues in either direction and on either side is a door,
{Wlan{Yte{Wrns{x light up the area around the doors, providing enough light to see
by but not enough light to blind the customers.  The ugly blotched carpet
seems to serve some purpose as it softens the tread of even the loudest of
walkers, making it so that those within the rooms are less disturbed then
they would be if people were allowed to clop up and down the bare wooden
floor of the hallway.

This room is furnished with only what is needed to sleep on for the

storing some clothes, a small table sits against one wall with a small
{Wmi{Crr{Wor{x hanging up above it so one can shave if needed while on the table
itself a clay bowl and pitcher sit.  There are windows to let in natural
light but at night only a simple {Wla{Ynte{Wrn{x is available to see with, there are
two hooks in the room for where it can be hung, one by the door for when a
person firsts enters and another a few feet from the bed so there is no
chance of a fire being started.  Though the room is cheap and simple it
serves its purpose for the sailors that want a warm place to sleep for the

Two flights of stairs later one reaches the top floor of the building,
one could almost feel bad for the servants that have to carry luggage and
buckets of water up this high.  Compared to the rest of the inn this floor
is very quiet, only the occassional sound of boots treading on the soft
plush {bc{Barpe{bt{x or the sound of a door opening is heard along with the
occassional sound of voices.

matress and {bblue{x sheets sits along one wall with a {ydresser{x not far for
storing some clothes, a table sits against one wall with a large {Wmi{Crr{Wor{x
hanging up above it so one can shave if needed while on the table itself a
clay bowl and pitcher sit.  There are windows to let in natural light and at
night two {Wla{Ynte{Wrn{x are available to see with, there are two hooks in the room
for where both can be hung, one by the door for when a person firsts enters
and another a few feet from the bed so there is no chance of a fire being
started.  Though small the room serves its purpose for the sailors that want
a warm place to sleep for the night.

The soft {bc{Barpe{bt{x continues down the hallway, silencing the foot falls so
that no one within the rooms that line the hallway are disturbed.  Each door
has simple but elegant {Dcarvings{x done into the {ywood{x some depict scenes of
sailing while others are of flowers and plants and others of animals, at
about eye level on each door a small hole has been drilled into the wood. 
Elegant looking {Wla{Dnter{Wns{x hang on either side of the doors, lightning up

A Fancy Bathing Room~
Much like the other rooms on this floor this one is filled with the same
elegence and expense.  Sparkling {Wwhite{x tiles with designs of softly colored
{bfl{mowe{brs{x show no dirt or grime on the floor.  Three large {Wbathtubs{x are placed
within the room in strategic points with screens set up around them that can
be moved to surround the tub if desired. In the middle of the room and in
the middle of the trio of tubs is a fire pit large enough to hold three pots
at once to heat water for the bathtubs, in one corner of the room a water
pump has been installed that allows one to actually get water this high up. 
Cabinets line the rooms, one holding towels and washclothes, another holding
soaps, bubble bath oil and scrub brushes while the third contains candles
and scented oils.  Numerous elegant, enclosed {Wla{Dnter{Wns{x provide soft lighting
about the room, enough to see by but not enough to ruin the relaxed mood of
the room.

The small hallway ends here as does the ugly ruined carpet, which appears
to be fraying along the edges in this section.  By the light of an enclosed
{Wla{Ynte{Wrn{x hanging by the door one can make out that the darker splotches on
the carpet have become more frequent, the door has no handle but can be
pushed over easily with ones foot and the hinges tend to squeek rather
badly.

A Cheap Bathing Room~
Two enclosed {Wlan{Yte{Wrns{x reveal a small room, it's wood floor is starting to
warp and is badly {Dstained{x from all the water and soap that gets splashed and
spilt onto it on a regular basis, with a large metal washing tub in one of
the corners and a {Dmetal{x wood burning stove opposite the tub but away from
the walls with a few simple tiles beneath it so the wood does not catch
fire.  Ontop of the {Dstove{x are two pots while beside the stove are two large
buckets, not far from the stove is a chair for placing clothing onto and
above that is a shelf with a few bars of soap.  There is no source of water
in the room and judging by the buckets, the pots and the stove one is
expected to prepare your own bath instead of someone doing it for you. 
There is also a {ysign{x hanging up near the tub that seem to contain
instructions.

The Watchers Over The Waves Headquarters~
The main room to the headquarters is always a bustle of activity as
guards go to and fro from the barracks portion of the building to the
village outside.  Message runners also dash in and out, heading in either
direction to what look like offices on either side of the building.  The
occassional sailor also saunters in, heading north into the only office with
a window.  The stone floors and walls have very little wood on them and have
no decoration either, the only exception is the wood flooring.

Lavish would be the one word that best describes the foyer to this home. 
From the rich, lush {bblue{x rug with its intricate {mdetailing{x to the paintings
and sculptures on display around the room are used as both a display of
wealth but also of power and influence.  An {yoak{x door across the room from
the main door has both the smells and sounds of the kitchen eminating from
it while to the right is the doorway to the living room.  To the left a set
of beautiful {yoak{x stairs leads up to the second floor of the house.

on a daily basis.  Comfortable {Darmchairs{x sit near the {Df{ri{Rr{Yepl{Ra{rc{De{x while three
cots are lined up in the middle of the room for those needing immediate
attention.  {yWooden{x chairs are set up as well for those that need minor
attention and are able to wait to be seen.  To the north a closed door keeps
the noise from bothering those in the recovery room.

The foyer is tasteful in its decoration, the paintings those of the
harbor and countryside of Falme, there are also busts of the former Mayors
along one wall along with a painting of each above that.  Across from the
main entrance is a door heading towards the back of the house but that
remains locked most of the time and a guard placed near the entrance makes
sure it remains that way.  To the left is the doorway to the waiting room of
the Mayor's office.

though the store is kept well organized and neat from the entrance all the
way back to the large counter in the back of the store behind which stands a

A Blacksmiths Shop~
{rH{Rea{rt{x fills the room in an almost oppressive manner and it all boils forth
from the large {Dh{re{Rar{rt{Dh{x on the farside of the room.  Not far from the hearth
are anvils of various sizes and not far from that is a large bucket of
water.  Piles of neatly stacked metals of various kinds sit away from the
hearth.  The ringing sound of a hammer on metal fills the Blacksmiths shop
all day as the man works hard to create that which is asked of him but is
always well paid for.  The {Dh{re{Rar{rt{Dh{x is kept hot by the constant wood thrown
into it by the Blacksmiths apprentice.  Through the door to the right more
hammering can be heard but not the loud hammering of metal being pounded
into form but something more precise and delicate.

Smaller in size then the previous room this one is not as hot for the
{Dh{re{Rar{rt{Dh{x is smaller and not kept quite as hot for the reforming of metal isn't
really needed here so much as the repairing of it is.  Armor is fixed as are
tools, swords and anything else metal in nature, all skillfully reshaped and
made whole by the blacksmiths wife who works just as hard as her husband but
works in the more intricate details, relying on precision and patience
rather then brute strength to reshape her work.  Sitting between the hearth
and a bucket is an anvil and by that a wooden stool for sitting, the rest of
the room has one side with broken pieces to be fixed and the other has those
fixed and waiting to be claimed.

The farm is just up ahead and the sea of {ggrass{x finally begins to reach
its end.  Back down the road the town of Falme is still easily seen but
instead of just seeing buildings close up you can now see its majestic
beauty from afar, its dark {Dslate{x roofs taking away the glare of the sun.  Up
ahead the sounds of a farm can be hear, the crickets more numerous here add
to the noise.

neighing coming from the barn this place sells horses.

There is no table in here but there is a stool for sitting on when a rest is

Plainly decorated the bedroom is large enough for two people, a queen sized
{ybed{x takes up most of the room and is covered with {mpurple{x sheets.  A large
{ydre{rs{yser{x sits beneath one of the windows along the west wall, the window is
covered with a {bblue{x curtain but when open reveals a beautiful view of the
countryside.  The squeaky floorboards makes it difficult to walk quietly in
this room.

A Large Barn~
The floor of the large barn is covered with {yhay{x and the occasional horse
dropping.  Stalls line the walls and almost every stall has a horse within
it except for a large stall at the end of the barn.  From behind the stall
door the sound of snorting and stomping can be heard, best not go there for
safety's sake.  A ladder near the door leads up into the hayloft.

A Stall~
Residing in this large stall is a big {Dblack{x bull, he takes up most of the
space and the rest is taken up by the feed bag and water bucket.  Hay covers
the floor as well as some rather smelly {ybrown{x piles that are obviously left
by the large bull.

A Set of Stalls~
Stalls line this side of the wall, the majority of them have horses of
various breeds, sizes and colors.  The stalls are all pretty clean and fresh
hay is laid down each day when the stalls are cleaned and the horses are fed
and taken out for exercise.  Each stall has a lock placed onto it and
considering that the barn itself was locked one can only assume these horses
are special to the owner.

The Attic~
The attic holds the owners most precious possessions, things like family
heirlooms and items acquired from trading horses fill most of the space up
here.  The place is pretty dust free and the items are covered with {Wwhite{x
sheets just incase.  Here and there trunks sit, some locked and some not,
one can only assume more heirlooms are kept within.

Like every other hayloft in the world this loft is filled with hay and
looking over the edge gives a view of most of the barn below as well as a
clear view of the door.  A pitchfork has been stabbed into one of the bales
of hay and it stands upright, waiting to be used once more.

for a single hooden {Yla{Dnte{Yrn{x that hangs down beside the ladder.  The four
doors in this room are kept closed but {Wli{Dg{Wht{x can be seen beneath each door,
filtering into the room to provide light across the floor.  Besides the
ladder and the lantern the room is pretty empty except for a large man
sitting near the southern door with a crossbow in his hand and a quiver
beside him.

end where serving wenches can go behind and get drinks as needed.  Large
barrels line the wall behind the bar, most likely filled with some cheap
ale.  Sailors make up most of the patronage here, spending most of their
money drinking and gambling, while guards from the city also come to spend
some time here.

A Tunnel Through the Cliff~
Very little light seeps in through the {gvines{x that block the entrance into
the cavern.  There are rocks strewn all over the narrow path that leads
deeper into the cliffs.  There is just enough space for one person to move
along, although a taller or heavier set person would have some difficulty
with the naturally worn looking path.

rocks strewn all over the narrow path that leads deeper into the cliffs.

The Tunnel Starts Rising~
The path starts to rise slowly and after a few feet suddenly stops, light
floods the space from above.  What looks like naturally worn in grooves in
the wall allow a person to climb up towards the opening in the cliff high
above.  It looks like a tight squeeze but it can be done if one takes their
time.

and far between the higher you go but just as the last couple foot holds
disappear the edge is finally within your grasp.

that seems to grow up here and covers the ground so that its spongy to walk
around.  Here and there a birds nest can be seen but not many as its far too
windy up here to nest properly.  Towards one end of the cliff a large rock
can be seen, its the largest thing up here by the looks of it.

The {Dstone{x building has wood floors and a couple of small windows in the
front on either side of the door.  Numerous {ywooden{x chairs line the walls for
those waiting their turn at the large desk at the back of the room. 
Numerous enclosed shelves line the back wall, kept closed so the items
within remain unharmed.  This room is usually very busy and there is always
a light on even in the middle of the night for one never knows when someone
might need to dock for the night.

Onwards and upwards along the never ending staircase that flows up
through the cliffs.  The walls have been carved smooth around the spiraling
staircase except for hand sized notches that are spaced in the wall, there
to provide a hand hold for those that need it as they walk.  Soon the sound
of howling wind enters the staircase and not long after a wooden door and a

except for hand sized notches that are spaced in the wall, there to provide
a hand hold for those that need it as they walk.  The sound of the waves is
non-existant now and the {Wli{Cg{Wht{x is almost too blindingly bright.  Eventually
a ceiling appears where the stairs end, leading up into a square hole where
the {Wli{Cg{Wht{x is definately the brightest.

Expensive furniture in a mix of {ymah{rogh{yany{x wood and plush {rred{x velvet are set
up in a central seating area infront of a large {Df{Ri{rr{Yepl{ra{Rc{De{x.  Paintings and
sculptures once again seem to line the walls around the room but in a
tasteful display.  The same {bblue{x carpeting in the foyer continues on into
this room, adding a soft cushion beneath the feet as one walks.

their way amoungst the tables serving drinks.

Busy only before meal time this kitchen holds every modern day
convenience available.  The head cook keeps everything in order, from the
pots and pans being hung up properly after their washed down to the counters
being cleaned to a sheen after every meal.  The smell of baking bread is the
most common here but during the dinner hour other delicious smells waft
about, such as roast lamb, curried chicken and numerous other wonderful
dishes.  The door separating the kitchen from the rest of the house is in
constant motion during meal time and occassionally is just propped open on
more busy occassions.

move along the hall without making too much noise.

Toys of every type and nature cover the floor, shelves and furniture in

of toys that are strewn over it, the bed seems to remain in a permanent
state of mess as if the servants have given up on making it.  Amidst the
toys a set of bookshelves can be seen but there are only a few books on it,
the rest of the space is also taken up by toys.  The {mpurple{x carpeting can
just be made out amidst the mess on the floor.

are lit.  In the {Dgloom{x of the room one can make out an old cradle near the
middle of the room and inside of it what looks to be a dusty old {yteddy{x bear
laid neatly inside of it.  A rocking chair sits in one corner near one of
the closed windows, occassionally rocking back and forth as if in memory of
times long past.  There are very few decorations in this room other then two
paintings in the room sitting on an old dressing table.  One looks to be
drawn by a child but one can make out the forms of four people, two big and
two little.  The other is a more formal painting of a small baby with wisps
of red hair and bright green eyes dressed in a cute little {bblue{x suit.  A
general feeling of sadness fills this room and one can only wonder what
happened to the little baby in the blue suit.

the room.  Dark, {Dg{wre{Dy{x carpeting aborbs a fair bit of the light though, as
much as it absorbs the soft sound of footfalls.  The study walls are lined
with bookshelves from the ceiling to the floor and in the middle of the room
is a large {yoak{x desk with a large comfortable looking {ggreen{x armchair behind
it and one infront of it as well.  Unlike the rest of the house there are no

Chairs fill most of the room except for the back wall where a large desk

the Mayor, the topics ranging from fishing to crops to anything and
everything a person could talk about.  A sturdy guard stands at the railing
of the stairs and infront of him is the desk and the receptionist that sits
behind it, both keeping order in their own ways.  Once chosen to see the
Mayor the guard lets you pass up onto the stairs and up into the second
story of the house.

room and comfortable chairs have been placed infront of it while a large
armchair sits behind it for the Mayor.  Shelves sit where there is space,
filled almost overflowing with books on various subjects.  To one side of
the door is another sturdy looking guard who watches the goings on with an
alert but almost blank expression.

beside it, a dressing table against one wall, a wardrobe not far from that. 
In one corner a comfortable armchair with a hanging lantern near it and a
bookshelf filled with books sit for easy reading.  A small set of stairs
lead down into what looks to be a library and unlike the stairs going into
the waiting room these are quiet to walk on.

of the store where a couple of the local fishermen run the shop.  This place

the surrounding land and water.  A few {ywooden{x chairs have been placed here

the shop with neat piles of paper stacked on it as well as closed cupboards
behind it.  A wall hanging on the back wall reads "{DBoat Rentals{x."

The forecastle is often just as busy as the rest of the ship for here is
where the crew eat and sleep, tasks which take up the rest of their time
when not working or on shore.  To one side the sounds of loud talk and the
smell of food wafts out into the corridor while the other side has the
sounds of snoring and soft mutterings coming from it.  In the middle of the
forecastle is part of the fore mast, it comes up through the floor from down
in the hold and goes straight up through to the forecastle deck and the sky
above.

{DBlack{x sails snap in the wind, the creak of the {ywood{x as the ship rocks
back and forth with the waves.  Never is there a quiet moment on this deck
for every sailor has his duties, wether its swabbing the deck or tending to
the sails this place is one of constant motion.  Stretched out before you is
almost the full length of the ship, from the main mast to the hatch to the
hold, the fore mast and at its end the forecastle.  Just behind is the door
to the Captain's quarters and above that the Quarter deck.

No expense was spared in the furnishing of this room, from rich {rlush{x
carpeting on the floor to the expensive paintings and wall hangings, even a
large {Wchan{Cde{Wlair{x hangs from the ceiling where it sways slowly with the
rocking of the ship.  {rMah{Dog{rany{x funiture takes up most of the space, from the
tables and chairs to the bed surrounded with {Ddrapes{x, all the furniture
except the chairs have been nailed to the floor so they do not move.  On a
large {rd{Des{rk{x maps, charts, lists and other various pieces of parchment are
neatly stacked or rolled, all held in place with weights or nails so nothing
is lost.

The Hold~

past the square there is nothing but {Ddarkness{x.  The creaking of the {ywood{x and
the sound of the {bwater{x against the sides of the ship fill this space with a
constant thrum of noise.  Cargo fills most of the space down here, lashed
securely in place with ropes.  Just outside the light a cage can be seen
hanging from the ceiling and from within it animal like sounds can be heard.
There is also the soft sound of what could be someone groaning but it can be
hard to make out against the other noises that fill the hold.

The Forecastle~
The forecastle is often just as busy as the rest of the ship for here is
where the crew eat and sleep, tasks which take up the rest of their time
when not working or on shore.  To one side the sounds of loud talk and the
smell of food wafts out into the corridor while the other side has the
sounds of snoring and soft mutterings coming from it.  In the middle of the
forecastle is part of the fore mast, it comes up through the floor from down
in the hold and goes straight up through to the forecastle deck and the sky
above.

The Captain's Cabin~
No expense was spared in the furnishing of this room, from rich lush
{bcarpeting{x on the floor to the expensive paintings and wall hangings, even a
large {Wchan{Dde{Wlair{x hangs from the ceiling where it sways slowly with the
rocking of the ship.  {rMah{yog{rany{x funiture takes up most of the space, from the
tables and chairs to the bed surrounded with {mdrapes{x, all the furniture
except the chairs have been nailed to the floor so they do not move.  On a
large {rd{yes{rk{x maps, charts, lists and other various pieces of parchment are
neatly stacked or rolled, all held in place with weights or nails so nothing
is lost.

Forecastle Deck~
The forecastle deck supports the fore mast and all its {Dsails{x, lookouts
spend most of their time around this part of the ship, wether up in the
sails or clinging to the bowsprite to keep an eye on the water so they ship
doesn't hit anything or run aground in shallow water.  Along the hull of the
ship is a figurehead of a beautiful {Wa{mnge{Wl{x, her arm outstretched and her hand
open as she releases a snowy {Wwhite{x dove.  The figurehead slices easily
through the water, guiding it safely to its destination.

The Hold~
Inside the hold hooded {Wlan{Dte{Wrns{x hang from the ceiling in a straight line
down the middle of the ship, providing light for those that carry the
supplies and other cargo down here.  Everything looks neat and organized,
each section of cargo roped off and tied together, this merchant ship is
obviously well run.

Quarter Deck~
Here is where the Captain and his first mate deal out the duties, here is
where the men of power do their duties.  A large {ywheel{x is manned by someone
at all times, wether by the Captain himself or someone he appoints, to not
keep hold of this wheel could mean the fate of both ship and crew.  Below
this deck is the Captain's quarters and over head is the large, {Dblack{x main
sail of the ship, billowing in the breeze.

Crew Quarters~
{WHammocks{x hang all over this room, from the walls to the beams, some high
some low almost like bunk beds.  Each sailor has a hammock and in it he can
secure any extra clothes or belongings if he wishes too, as few as those
belongings might be.  Very rarely during the day are any of the sailors
sleeping, except for maybe those on night duty, this is their time to sleep
and they do so rather noisily, their snores filling up the room.

The Galley~
Loud and smelly are two words perfect for this part of the ship.  The men
seem to like to talk loudly while eating and drinking while the smell of the
'food' the galley cook is making fills the rest of the void.  {yTables{x and
{ybenches{x have been nailed to the floor in the space that the cook doesn't
need for his stores and the stove.  In the kitchen section a large {Dpot{x sits
simmering over a {rf{Rl{Ya{Rm{re{x, the bubbling ooze seems to contain carrots, potatoes
and meat, if the chunks that are floating in it can be called that.

The Crew Quarters~
Bunk beds take up every available space in the quarters, nailed down onto
the floor and into the beams between each set so that no accidents occur. 
Each sailor has his own bed, a place to sleep and also to keep extra clothes
tucked safely beneath warm {Dwoolen{x blankets.  Although the quarters are
nothing fancy its still comfortable and as roomy as possible.  Here and
there in their bunks men can be seen dozing, mostly the night watchmen.

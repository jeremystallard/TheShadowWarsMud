A {WB{wo{gr{Ddergu{ga{wr{Wd {WL{wi{ge{Duten{ga{wn{Wt{w strides along purposefully.

This guard has a stone faced expression as moves with a quick stride to
get where he is headed.  Occasionally looking into the eyes of someone who
catches his eye, he nods to acknowledge salutes and salutes those of his
superiors he passes.  He seems to be unconsciously looking for something
wrong.  He wears baggy dark grey trousers tucked into dark black turned down
boots.  His uniform coat is a dark black surcoat.  Two dark green stripes
around the cuff of his coat reveals his rank.  Over his shoulders peek two
wrapped green and black leather hilts.  His long braided hair has bells at
the ends.

A {WB{wo{gr{Ddergu{ga{wr{Wd {WC{wa{gp{Dt{ga{wi{Wn{w seems to be looking for someone or something.
~
This officer has a stone faced expression as he watches all of the
soldiers who pass by.  Occasionally looking into the eyes of someone who
catches his eye, he pulls aside one or two to comment if their uniform is
anyway out of line.  He seems to be unconsciously looking for something
wrong.  He wears baggy dark grey trousers tucked into dark black turned down
boots.  His uniform coat is a dark black unadorned surcoat.  Three dark
green stripes around the cuff of his coat and a golden bar pinned on his
right collar reveals his rank.  At his hip is a broadsword with a wrapped
green and black leather hilt.

A Dank, Dark Cell~
Very little light streams into this room from the holes in the door,
leaving this small cell dark and dank.  A small cot is against the far wall,
and an old pile of mildewing hay covers the floor.  A strong, retched odor
seems to seep up through the hay, perhaps something died in here recently.

A well-lit hallway~
Marble covers the floor with thick wooden pillars supporting the walls. 
Beautiful golden lanterns hang on the wall lighting the room so there are no
shadows.  There are three doors in the hallways, one in each direction, with
the common room back to the north.  Nothing can be heard coming from the
rooms, but the sound of the common room echos slightly on te marble.

A simple guest room~
This room is just slightly larger than the other two in the hallway.  The
lights in here are the same types of lanterns that are in the hallways,
making sure that there are no shadows anywhere in the room.  A large bed
sits in the middle of the room, big enough to hold two full size men, and
made of ancient sungwood.  A water basin stands along the west wall, near a
large mirror and a desk.  Large warddrobes take up the rest of the wall. 
There are a few hooks just inside the door for cloaks and coats to hung. 
Along the east wall in a tapestry depicting a thunderstorm over a vast array
of fields, warriors and disfigured beings all held motionless as the bright
light strikes a spot on the ground.

A large walk-in closet~
The light from the door only reaches so far into the closet.  Darkness
fills the rest of the space.  A damp and moldy smell fills the air, and gets
stronger the further back into the closet you go.  A hanger for clothes can
be felt along one wall, with clothes hanging from it, but it is too dark to
see exactly what they are.  On the backside of the closet door is a
handprint done in what is now old darkened blood, but is still as clear as
can be.

There is a small fence along the edge of the building to keep people from
falling off accidently, along with a few wooden chair sitting around a
tables.  All of them look to be a bit weather worn as there is no cover here
beneath the sky.  A few small barrels sit in one corner, looking abandoned.

The Dive~
This room is very dark, and there are no windows.  Table are set up
without order and a small dirty bar, with half filled bottles is in the far
corner.  The floor doesn't look like it has ever been cleaned.  Rotten food
and liquid have mixed in with the mud and dirt, making it very rare to see
the wood that actual makes up the floor.  There is a door to the north, but
it has been bolted closed, and then covered up with boards so that no one
can enter.

The smell in this room is horrible.  Blood has been splattered over the
entire thing.  A bed of rags lies in the corner with a table sitting in the
middle of the room.  Shackles hang off the table, while other instruments
hang from the walls.  Pieces of hair, fingernails, and flesh can be seen
lying beneath the table.

The Road to Maradon~
In the distance, the towers of Maradon are starting to be visible.  The
ground is covered in a white blanket of snow.  Ahead some men and women are
shuffling along on snow shoes.  The tree limbs droop with snow and ice, the
ice tipped branches nearly touching the ground.  Off to the south east, the
road continues through the Plain of Lances and to Tar Valon.

looks almost organic as the guard towers spiral up into the air on either
side, and the thick walls flow around the buildings.  More guards stand
inside the gate, just ensuring no one enters who appears as if they will be

looks almost organic as the guard towers spiral up into the air on either
side, and the thick walls flow around the buildings.  More guards stand
inside the gate, just ensuring no one enters who appears as if they will be
trouble.

Guards stand by the gate, watching everyone who enters the gate.  As the
wagons enter the city, each are searched to ensure nothing passes through
unnoticed.  Snow drifts up against the walls, but it is cleared away on the
road into the city.

The road seems to spiral around the outside of the city, leading north
east or south west.  The road seems to be quiet before the dwelling to the
south.  No colors or distinguishing features stand out from the street, and
it appears there are no draperies in the upper windows.

curtains visible in the upper windows.

Around the Palace~
The walls of the path arc around the palace, following the lines of it as
the city forms itself around the central building.  Soldiers can be seen
crossing the road to the north, and the clanging of swords can somtimes be
heard over the din of the passing people.  Carriages holding various nobles
or merchants pass the street, trying to stay out of the way of the bustling
city folk.

can be heard over the din of the passing people.

Around the Palace~
This path around the Palace continues in a large organic spiral.  Two
snow drifts of thick marble seem to clash at one point in this wall.  When
they part to reveal an entrance to the royal columned courtyard and parade
grounds, guards are always present.  Guards flank either side of the drifts
every hour, watching for possible intruders.

A faint light seems to be apparent in the distance, though it seems hard
to get your bearings on the direction, as the stairs you have followed
spiraled down to this point.  The walls are cold, signifying some depth
beneath the palace, but they are dry and lack moisture, signifying solid
construction.

its edges.  The fire in the brazier has been snuffed out and the bench near

once beautiful, now seems to have exploded as the sap inside froze, sending
bark everywhere in this corner of the garden.

There are also other smaller coaches along the walls for anyone who may be

marble of the walls are cut to hold lamps which cast light off the gilded
carriages, making them look more impressive in the wavering shadows.  Young

This road spirals to the west and east leading to and from the palace.

street.  A house sigil is carved into the door to the north.  There are
guards flanking the door wearing the livery of a minor House of Saldaea. 
The south door has banners showing the house sigil of the Minor House of
Saldaea.  A single guard stands outside this house, looking almost as a
statue as he holds his place.

On the Roof~
This room feels no warmer than the last.  Slits in the wall allow one to
watch as the birds fly from the palace and then the city on their way
southwards to the land of their destination.  Two large braziers try to keep
the area warm, but whisps of cold air seep in through the window slits
without fail.

rather cramped and cold room.

Fly Away!~
This small courtyard is built open to the sky so the birds can fly up and
away to their destinations.  Empty cages are set into carved niches in the
marble walls to await the return of their occupants.  Two rooms are set off
to either side, but noisy flapping seems to be coming from the east.

noise and there is a bit of an unpleasant aroma from so many feathered
beasts in one small area.  The room is warm with the heat from a large
central brazier which casts a bright glow on the whole room.

At the top of this stairwell, there is a small corridor which appears to
be at the pinnacle of the Palace.  A small hallway seems to lead towards the
west where there is the sound of fluttering birds in cages.  The walls are
covered in long velvet drapes to keep the sound from reflecting down to the
lower levels, and their dark blue hue seems to lend to the serious quietness
of the place.

A Walk around the Walls~
Sparkling stone spikes are arrayed above the small window which looks
down into the city.  They wait to impale any who would try to climb over the
walls of this place, blending in like a beautifully deadly decoration. 
Guardsmen patrol the walkway, looking both down into the city and out
towards the northwest for any sign of trouble.

A Walk around the Walls~
The fortified stone walls enclosing this city continue to sweep like a
drift of snow overhanging this small walkway which is built inside the
massive walls.  The long glittering spikes of stone are built into the tops
of the wall on either side so it almost blends in as a beautiful decoration.
Small slits are cut into the sides just big enough to see out of and set an
archer's bow in them.

A Walk around the Walls~
Circling the city are thick walls of fortified stone.  Built into these
walls is the walkway upon which only guardsmen seem to roam.  Archers are
set up at posts at each of the slits in the walls, on constant watch for any
who approach the city from the northwest.  A fire burns in a brazier of
coals against the back walls, warming the men, and keeping an assortment of
arrows red hot for any enemy who may come close to the City.

A Walk around the Walls~
Circling the city are thick walls of fortified stone.  Built into these
walls is the walkway upon which only guardsmen seem to roam.  Archers are
set up at posts at each of the slits in the walls, on constant watch for any
who approach the city from the southwest.  A fire burns in a brazier of
coals against the back walls, warming the men, and keeping an assortment of
arrows red hot for any enemy who may come close to the City.

A Walk around the Walls~
Sparkling stone spikes are arrayed above the small window which looks
down into the city.  They wait to impale any who would try to climb over the
walls of this place, blending in like a beautifully deadly decoration. 
Guardsmen patrol the walkway, looking both down into the city and out
towards the southwest for any sign of trouble.

A Walk around the Walls~
The fortified stone walls enclosing this city continue to sweep like a
drift of snow overhanging this small walkway which is built inside the
massive walls.  The long glittering spikes of stone are built into the tops
of the wall on either side so it almost blends in as a beautiful decoration.
Small slits are cut into the sides just big enough to see out of and set an
archer's bow in them.

seems to seep up through the hay, perhaps something died in here recently.

A Dank, Dark Cell~
Very little light streams into this room from the holes in the door,
leaving this small cell dark and dank.  A small cot is against the far wall,
and an old pile of mildewing hay covers the floor.  A strong, retched odor
seems to seep up through the hay, perhaps something died in here recently.

A Dark Hallway~
Faint light is visible from torches set on the walls.  The air is thin
down here which makes the darkness that much more oppresive.  There are
doors off to either side, with small barred holes visible in them.

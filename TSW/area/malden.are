Malden Entrance~
The main road leads out through the gates of the city to the west, or on
towards the fortress to the east.  It intersects here with the north-south
running east wall road which follows the city wall from one end of the city
to the other.  The road is kept in good repair as are the city walls. 
Soldiers patrol the wall overhead throughout day and night.  Their numbers
may not be large, but they are vigilant.

defense against the petty wars and disputes that happen now and then in
Altara.  The street is paved with smooth paving stones and stretches out to
the east and west, following the southern wall.  Small shops open their
doors onto the street from the north.

Southeast Tower~
The southern wall meets the eastern wall at this intersection.  The
stones come together to form a nearly seemless corner, built together to
form a strong protection for the city.  Two hundred meters to the north lies
the cities cistern, a large pool of water 50 meters long by almost 100
meters wide and several meters deep.  An aqueduct from the lake five miles
to the east keeps the cistern full and provides running water to the cities
population.  

The guard tower rises up above the wall, providing protection for the guards
who patrol the walls.

fortress wall, not very deep, but wide enough for deliveries to be made.

Fortress' Service Entrance~
The Fortress wall meets up with the city wall at this point.  A sturdy
oaken door is here admitting the servants and deliveries for the fortress
itself.  It has a pair of guards tending to it and it appears to be quite
able to be barred from the inside.  The occasional guard can be heard
overhead traversing the wall and keeping an eye on things.

Kitchen~
{WB{wu{Ds{Wy{x is not a word that does justice to describe the kitchen.  It buzzes
with people and noise.  The {Yt{yile{Yd{x {yf{Yl{yoor{x has small {cp{Co{cols{x from {cw{Ca{cter{x that has
dripped or formed around the {Dm{we{Dtal {ci{Cc{ce {Db{wo{Dx{x.  The sink is made with a {Wwh{wi{Wte
{Wm{wa{Drb{wl{We{x and has some plates and glasses in it waiting to be washed.  The
{Wt{wi{Wled{x walls have {yg{Wr{ye{Wa{yse{x marks and {cold water {cs{Dta{cins{x.  The assistant cooks run
from one side to the other, between the south door to the pantry where the
food is stored and the large brick {rs{Rt{Yo{Rv{re{x.  The maids try to keep everything
clean while the men make a mess.

stretching out towards the fortress in the east.  The walls rise high
overhead and guards patrol atop of it.  Here at the main gates the soldiers
stand guard, welcoming friends and visitors, but asking each stranger their

The walled city of Malden is to the north.  It's walls are high, and
about 400 meters long per side.  The city is nestled at the base of a hill
with an aqueduct bringing water from a remote lake visible on the eastern
side of the city.  Guards walk the city walls and check people in at the
gates on the western side of the city.  Farms stretch out all about the city
and provide the city with the food needed to supply the citizens and keep

The room is {yl{Yi{yt{x by {rt{Ror{Ych{Re{rs{x bolted to the walls with {Diron {Db{wr{Dackets{x and it
smells like old and {Dd{yi{Dr{yt{Dy{x.  There is a small {ystool{x for the punished guard on
duty to sit on even though this place seems to have been {We{wmpt{Wy{x for years.

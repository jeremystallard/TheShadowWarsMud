arafellin soldier guard~
an {rAr{Ra{Wfel{Rl{rin {DSo{wldi{Der{x~
An {rAr{Ra{Wfel{Rl{rin {DSo{wldi{Der{x is here, going about his business.
~
Hardened in battle, these soldiers were raised to kill the Shadowspawn
that plauge the northern lands without fear of death.  They flow from place
to place, the recruits even seeming to have a deadly stride.  The weapons
they carry don't not just look like part of them, they are part of them,
like an extension of their arms.

perfecting the already deadly soldiers.

The blacksmith, while shorter then the other soldiers, has arms at least
double that of any of the soldiers.  He holds an enormous hammer, which he
continually uses to pound out new weapons and armor for the many soldiers of
this tower.  Even as a blacksmith, his movements have a deadly gracefulness
to him, and the heat of the room never touches him.

A young woman sporting for a duel is here.
~
Stormy grey eyes, an obviously broken nose, thin bloodless lips, and a
square jaw are framed by a mass of curly reddish brown hair.  Her snug
bodice accentuates her curves, while her dark skirt is offset by many
brightly colored petticoats.  She fingers the hilt of her daggers as she
glares at everyone passing by.

A Dirt Path~
A quaint road twists through a thin {gfo{yr{gest{x, winding down towards a small
village that rests a little low in the landscape.  The area is filled with a
gentle, calming {Wch{Ci{Wll{x that is common in lands so far north.  The sounds of
various creatures are heard rather easily, from the soft {Yme{rlo{Ydy{x of various
chirping, to the {Dmo{wnoto{Dne{x sound of many insects.  The village appears rather
small in size, yet it is surrounded by strong walls, with a few towers meant
solely for defense.  In the far distance, the {Dsil{whoue{Dtte{x of a tall border
tower can be seen looming over the landscape, vigilantly surveying the
{YBl{yig{Yht{x for even the most minuscule of changes.

A beautiful melody adds a relaxing feel to the forest, freely given by

While the trees are of varying heights, they all have a few similar
qualities.  All have low branches, which tend to be very thick and able to
support a lot of weight.  Many house the various creatures of the forest.

forest~
The forest is made up of sparse, hardy {gtr{yee{gs{x, that hold well in the cold

to support the weight of large snow.  Soft sounds echo through the forest,
and small animals occasionally run past from tree to tree.

A Dirt Path~
The {ypath{x widens a little as it nears the {yvi{Ylla{yge{x, and the sparse {gfo{yre{gst{x
thins to a few solitary trees that dot the landscape.  The soft {Cmu{Ws{Cic{x of the
forest begin to dissipate as the more human {Yme{rlo{Ydy{x of a small village begins
to overtake them.  Still, the voice of the {yvi{Ylla{yge{x is quiet, consisting
mainly of horses hooves, the occasional shout, and the hammering of {Dm{weta{Dl{x. 
While the village can be seen more clearly, the view of the border tower is
somewhat hindered by it's {Dw{wall{Ds{x, and is still little more than a {Dsh{wad{Dow{x.

E
village~
The village is only a short distance away, and can be seen rather
clearly.  Large protective walls surround it, which from behind come the
soft sounds of town life.  The path leads up to it's small, yet strong
gates, changing rather quickly into a stone road.  
~
E
forest~
The forest becomes very thin and sparse, with only a few trees dotting
the landscape.  A few animals are still seen now and then, though it has
become very rare.  
~
E
music~
The music of the forest has died significantly, becoming a dull hum of
bird's chirping and a few insects.  
~
E

The small village has a soft melody streaming from behind it's walls,
consisting mainly of horses hooves, metal pounding, and the occasional
shout.  Otherwise, it has become rather quiet.  
~
E
walls~
The walls of this small village are quite tall, and thick, allowing for a
walkway above them.  They are well built, with thick, carved stones, and
strong mortar holding them together.  
~
E
tower~
Less of the Tower is visible as the village wall begins to hide it from
view.  Even closer, it still appears as a mere shadow on the horizon.

The Southern Entrance To The Border Village~
The {ypath{x widens to fit the strong {Dg{wate{Ds{x that serve as the entrance to the
small village.  As the hard-packed dirt meets the {Dg{wate{Ds{x, it quickly becomes
consumed with stones, forming a stronger pathway that leads through the
city.  To each side of the gate are pair of {Dto{wwe{Drs{x, made fully for defensive
purposes.  The soft {Cme{Wlo{Cdy{x of the city consists of the occasional voice,
horses hooves, and hammers, but little else.  The {Dw{wall{Ds{x of the village stand
high, and consist of strong mortar and stone, and mostly block the view of
the large {Dbo{wrd{Der to{ww{Der{x in the distance.

Large gates rise up, giving access to the city.  The steel bars and heavy
locks provide a strong barrier for such a small village.  To the sides are
strong stone and mortar, forming {Dto{wwe{Drs{x.  The path widens to meet the gates,
becoming a hard stone walkway as it continues into the village.

seen close by, looming over the {Ds{wton{De{x {Dr{woa{Dd{x.  A few people roam the streets,
though the village appears rather peaceful and quiet, with only the

The Lower Floor Of The Tower~
Stairs lead down to the lower section of the tower, which is very well
lit by several lamps.  A couple soldiers guard a door to the south, while
from the door to the north you can smell food being cooked.  Not many people
pass down here, though every once and awhile a guard will come down.

The Tower Kitchen~
Only two guards stand in this room, which seem to keep getting disturbed
by the cooks to try something new.  Cooks line the room, with several ovens
heating food, chopping vegetables, and preparing many other meals.  The room
is rather hot from the steam, but the food smells delicious.  To the south
is the stairs leading to the other sections of the tower, while to the north
is a storeroom for food.

A Storeroom~
Barrels and sacks of food cover this enormous room.  Obviously created in
case the tower was ever under siege, the food could feed the soldiers here
for months.  A few soldiers patrol the room, or sit on the sacks talking to
each other or playing with dice.  To the south is the kitchen, as well as
the stairs to the other floors.

A Guard Room~
Five guards stand in this room, guarding a stairway leading down to the
deepest part of this tower, the jails.  The room is well lit, and smells
rather nice because of the nearby kitchen.  The room could deffinitely hold
more guards, if the need arose, but it doesn't look as if they've ever had
any trouble.  To the north lies the stairway to the other levels of the
tower, as well as the kitchen.

The Prisons~
Guards patrol these well lit halls, which lead north and south.  Most of
the cells look empty, though the remains of a recent occupant can be seen in
some.  Other then that, it seems rather quiet.  Stairs lead up to the guard
room, while cells line the north and south hallway.

A guard patrols the halls, though the cells look rather empty.  Lamps
line the walls, and the bars of a cell are on the left and right of you. 
The cells don't seem to hold many occupants, and the entire hallway seems
oddly quiet.  The hallway continues north to the end, and south, which also
leads to the stairway back up to the tower.

constantly, either inspecting, cleaning, or picking up armor and taking it
with them.  The room seems fairly clean, and it looks as though the soldiers
keep the armor well polished.

frequent the room, cleaning, polishing, or taking weapons, which there

obviously recruits, enter to clean and polish the shields.  In the center of

Soft, feather mats cover the floor of this room, keeping people from
cracking their heads on stone.  The stone walls are also padded, with small
slits for arrows cutting thin holes into the padding.  The southern wall is
lined with many different types of practice weapons, all made of wood.  The
room smells of sweat, and seems rather hot compared to the other rooms. 
Soldiers enter and leave the room, most staying to listen to the instructor.

Wooden tables form rows in the room, most of them already occupied with
soldiers eating quickly.  Smells of well cooked, spiced food fill your nose,
and the conversation of many soldiers buzz in your ears.  Recruits move
about, collecting plates and cups, as well as cleaning the empty tables. 
Most of the discussion seems to be about the Blight, while other topics
include daily life and training.  Every once and awhile a table of soldiers
bursts out in laughter, but for the most part the room seems rather
peaceful.

Wooden tables form rows in the room, most of them already occupied with
soldiers eating quickly.  Smells of well cooked, spiced food fill your nose,
and the conversation of many soldiers buzz in your ears.  Recruits move
about, collecting plates and cups, as well as cleaning the empty tables. 
Most of the discussion seems to be about the Blight, while other topics
include daily life and training.  Every once and awhile a table of soldiers
bursts out in laughter, but for the most part the room seems rather
peaceful.

An Office~
A wooden desk sits in the center of the room, with a padded chair behind
it.  Few soldiers enter or leave this room, unless summoned by it's
occupant.  Papers cover the desk, well organized, as well as a ink bottle
and a few pens.  Several chairs stand in front of the desk, and paintings
hang on the wall, depicting battles against the Shadowspawn.  A good
reminder of the location of this tower.

The Infirmary~
Several comfortable beds line the eastern wall of this large room. 
Cabinets and counters rest against most of the other walls, full of medical
supplies of all types.  Men in white coats move from soldier to soldier,
tending to any wounds.  The smell of herbs fills the room, and the sounds of
footsteps echo in the hallways outside.  A few of the cabinets hold some
interesting herbs, though the doctors probably wouldn't appreciate it if
anyone but they touched the herbs.

A small pathway leads from the door to a wooden stand at the far end of
the room.  Along the pathway, long wooden benches stretch to each wall.  Few
soldiers enter the room unless a meeting is taking place, though some
recruits still enter to keep the room clean.  Papers hang on the walls,
showing everything from today's activities to supplies that need to be
bought.  Sounds of footsteps echo from the hallway to the east, as well as an
occasional voice, but they disappear quickly.

Several soldiers fill this small yard, each practicing forms with a
wooden weapon under the instruction of a Sergeant.  The clash of wood fills
your ears, but the cool breeze seems to take away the harshness of the
sounds.  Other soldiers march in and out of the entrance of the tower, some
returning with various supplies.

The Blacksmith~
A short man who looks to be twice the width of the normal soldiers stands
behind a large iron anvil.  Dressed in a dirty version of the Shienaran
uniform, he wields his large hammer to pound steel into weapons and armor
for use by the Shienaran soldiers.  The heat of the forge burns hot enough
to bring sweat to any man's face in an instant, but the blacksmith works in
it as if it doesn't effect him in any way.

Fewer people are among this road then they are the Main Road, but the
buzz of life still exists.  People barely glance at you as they make their
way east or west down the hard stone pathway.  The sound of a blacksmith's
hammer rings in your ears, as well as the shout of hawkers and other selling
their goods.  A guard walks the streets now and then, watching for trouble,
but few others look armed.

A Blacksmith~
The crash of a hammer pounding out {Dst{wee{Dl {rAr{Ra{Wfel{Rl{rin{x weapons and other
metal items nearly blocks out the numerous voices of the villagers in the
small {rAr{Ra{Wfel{Rl{rin{x town.  {RH{Yea{Rt{x pours onto you the moment you enter, and the
steam from the numerous barrels filled with water to cool off finished {Dst{wee{Dl{x
adds to the horribly hot blacksmith shop.  The man behind the billows is
twice as wide as most men, with enormous arms.  He gives you little more
then a glance with cold, hard eyes, before returning to his forge seeming to
ignore you.

work.  All around the room, different types of {Dst{Wee{Dl{x armor hangs on pegs on
the wooden walls.  The room is as hot as an oven, and the steam from the
barrels of cool water that finished suits of mail are put in only adds to
the inferno.  The clash of the large man's hammer nearly blocks the sounds
of the citizens, but they can still be heard easily whenever the door is

bread creates another wonderful aroma to this quaint shop.

The general store is a rather large building, with row after row of tools

examines you as you enter from behind a wooden counter, then, seeming
satisfied, returns to his reading.  Shelves line the walls, filled with
anything a commoner, soldier, or adventurer would need during his travels. 
Behind the counter lie many crates, full of other items to be made for sale
later.  Various people shop around, though no one gives anyone else much
more then a glance.

Entrence To The Residential Section~
A {Ds{wton{De{x archway with a {Ds{wton{De{x fence lashing out from each side separates
the city and the residential area.  Citizens of the medium sized village
wander about, entering and leaving the main city or walking to other houses.
An occasional horse or ox-driven cart passes through the arch, but compared
to the main city, this section is rather quiet.

to be lit at night, and street signs show up at every intersection.  For the
most part, this section of the city is rather quiet compared to the rest.

interesting seems to lie to the west or south besides those few houses,
though.  A {Yl{Wa{Yn{Wt{Ye{Wr{Yn{x that is lit at night to light up this intersection
dangles above you, tied to a pole.

the room, providing warmth to the quaint little home.

you lies rusty steel gates leading to an old abandoned house.  Paint seems
ripped away from the walls, and the few window shutters still attached to
the house barely hang on their hinges.  The few people who look at the house
cast fearful glances at it, though most just avoid looking at it as if it
were inhabited by the Dark One himself.

Inside the Abandoned House~
Dust seems to be the only evidence of a lack of human existence inside
this building.  Everything else seems in perfect condition.  Portraits of
the family who must have owned the large structure hang along a wall, going
upwards along with the rounded stairs that lead up to the upper floor.  One
a woman with long golden hair and a sly grin.  Another, a man with hard eyes
but a comforting grin.  The next portrait up is a man who resembles a
youthful version of the previous.  Brown hair and warm eyes, he looks to be
in his twenties.  The final picture is of a small girl, less then ten years
old.  She holds a bear and smiles with the innocence all young children
posses.

rooms of the house.  A few unlit lamps line the walls, that look as though
they haven't been lit in many years by the silk webs of spiders that run
through their openings.

still lay scattered along it's surface.  Rays if sunlight shine through it's

them.  Nothing stirs in the room besides you, making it seem early quiet.

The Trolloc's Horn~
Named because of the line of trolloc's horns on it's doorway, this inn is
one of the main gathering places of this small border village.  Men and
soldiers mingle and drink and entertain in this large inn tavern.  The smell
of home cooked meals rings in your nostrils as a waiter passes by, carrying
a tray of food.  Behind the counter the innkeeper/bartender smiles at you,
waiting for you to approach.

The Common Room~
This appears to be the main area of the inn.  A large bar sits in the
corner, and several maids and waitresses rush about serving and cleaning. 
Soldiers and citizens fill the room with laughter and talk, and they all
appear to be drinking.  A set of stairs leads up into the upper floors of
the inn, while to the west is the entrance to the inn and another area of
the common room.  Lanterns line the wall of the inn, illuminating it's high
spirited area.

The Upper Level~
The hallway extends in three directions :North, South, and East.  To the
west is a balcony overlooking the street below.  A maid passes by now and
then, gliding along the smooth carpeted floors without giving you her
attention, but otherwise this intersection is silent.  Lamps light the way
to the different rooms.

The Hallway~
The hallway leading away from the intersection stops abruptly.  Two doors
remain closed along it, with lamps on each side of them.  The smooth carpet
creaks as you move, but otherwise the hallway remains perfectly silent.  A
maid passes by now and then, checking the lamps and the rooms.

An Inn Room~
A good sized bed rests in the corner of the room, beckoning those who
enter to sleep on it's well cushioned surface.  A warm {Bblue{x blanket is
neatly made on top of it, while some thin sheets under it provide extra
comfort and warmth.  The room is well lit by several lanterns that follow
the walls of the room, including one on the desk which is pushed against one
wall.  A clock ticks in the corner of the room, and a small, clean little
dresser sits next to the bed.

Within The South Gate~
{DShade{x surrounds this small area, covered above by the arch structure of
the stone {Dg{wat{De{x.  Though an occasional faint {Wso{Cu{Wnd{x can be heard from within
the gate walls, the strong stone and mortar make a very effective barrier
for most sound.  The stone path continues far into the city, upon which a
few various individuals roam.  Soft city sounds echo through the streets,
though it seems mostly a peaceful {yvi{Ylla{yge{x.

The village is rather peaceful and quiet, with soft sounds and a few
people along the streets, though not much else can be seen.

Faint sounds can be heard within the city, and occasionally from within
the walls of the gate, though it otherwise appears rather quiet.

gate~
The arch of the gate's peak stands roughly twelve feet from the ground,
and curves down to meet the dirt.  Large iron gates loom on each side,
waiting to be shut.

shade~
The shadows under the gate fill the small area at all times of day,
mercilessly depriving the ground from any light except that which is
occasionally brought through by a traveler or guard.

A Balcony~
This outdoor jut from the inn overlooks the Main Street below.  Throngs
of people move through the street by day, and this little spot also gives a
good view of the Blight and the Tower that guards against it in the
distance.  Lights are fixed to the walls to the left and right of the
Balcony, giving light for those who wish to come out here at night for any
reason.  Vines growing around it's rail and a soft breeze make this spot
rather beautiful.

A Dirt Path~
Here a small dirt path leads off the stone road of the town.  Very little
vegetation grows here, but the townsfolk seem to have lined the area with
decorative stones and planted what will survive along the path, making it a
nice little area to stroll in.

A Small Pathway~
The dirt pathway continues here, giving way to more natural life, the
sounds of animals moving in their homes audible.  A bit of moisture seems to
touch the air as the sound of a nearby brooke begins to touch the air.

A Small Pathway~
The pathway twists and turns away from the village, fewer and fewer
people seem to come this way.  The path makes its way up over a short hill,
giving view to a bubbling brooke nearby.  The vegetation seems to flourish
near the brooke, the water which is so scarce in this area giving life where
it is much needed.

Beside A Bubbling Brooke~
The dirt pathway leads up to the side of the brooke, the smell of fresh
water seems to hang on the air.  The brooke meanders in from the north and
makes its way through the land to the southeast.  Off across the brooke is a
small area that seems to be surprisingly green and peaceful.

A Meadow~
The moisture from the brooke seems to have done this area much good. 
Green seems to grow in the unlikeliest of places, trees and plants sprouting
up from the soil so near the border of death to north.  Birds can be heard
chirping in the air above and the tracks of larger, docile creatures can be
seen in the ground below.

A Secluded Area~
Around the curve of the brooke this small cove hides itself from the view
of passersby.  Many a village teenager has spent hours here, wooing his
sweetheart.  A large boulder with a smooth surface serves as a place to rest
ones weary feet.  The sounds of wildlife scampering about nearby can be
heard all around, and the ground is covered with smooth pebbles, worn down
by the moving water.

Common Room of the Iron Plow~
The Iron Plow seems to be the place all the farmers that come to the
Tavar to sell their wares stay while they are away from their farms.  Many
tables with benches are spread throughout the room, and serving girls move
about, tending to their customers needs.  Standing near the fireplace is a
young man in a straw hat, playing a fiddle to entertain the farmers.

The Kitchens of the Iron Plow~
The strong odor of onions permeates the air in this room, along with the
sound of bubbling liquids.  A large cauldron is set on a spit in the
fireplace, the evenings meal being prepared.  A long counter of a thick,
durable wood stretches across half of the kitchen, atop it lay different
vegetables that are being cut up for the meal.

The Larder~
A narrow-stepped ladder leads down into this damp, dank room.  Shelves
line the walls of the larder, each filled with bottles and jars or a variety
of foods.  Sacks of flour and oats have been piled atop the dirt floor, a
trail of tiny white pawprints in the dirt leads across the dirt floor.

A Fish Shop~
When one enters this shop, the air suddenly seems to swirl as the cold
frostiness of the room moves about.  The counters here are covered with ice,

at those who enter the shop.

A long bar divides the common room from the door leading back into the
kitchen, behind the bar is the large innkeeper who passes out drinks and
keys alike.  A staircase leads upstairs while another door leads to a
private dining room.

The Kitchen~
The large kitchen is always busy, meals are prepared at all times of the
day and the innkeeper's wife keeps all the kitchen help busy as she
supervises as well as helps cook.  The backdoor is always left open so that
a breeze airs out the kitchen and helps keep it a bit cooler with the ovens
going in an already hot city.

large {yb{ra{yr{x rests against the north wall, an open window just behind it.  Two
large stone {rf{Ri{Yr{Re{Dp{wl{Wac{we{Ds{x are set in opposite walls, giving off ample heat to
fill the room.  Colorful {gt{Gap{Ye{Wst{Yr{Gie{gs{x cover the walls between large windows. 
The walls are a plain gray color, nearly matching the stone floor below. 
Serving girls rush around the room to fill the patrons orders as quickly as
possible.  The sound of laughter and merriment can be heard to the south,
and the door to the east continues further into the Inn.

Inn Yard~
The spacious yard is fenced in to help protect both the Inn's assets and
the Guests assets.  A large brown mongrel runs around the yard, sniffing at
everything and everyone, making sure that you know that you are now on HIS
territory.  A large stable is set up near the back of the property for
housing the guests horses and an open area beside the stables is reserved
for parking carriages and wagons.  

An attempt to grow grass in the yard to fight off the ever present mud of
the city is an ever ongoing process.  Parts of the yard are lush and green,
while the path from the gate to the stables is worn down and has mud showing
through now and then.

Fresh {ystraw{x covers the stable floor and the smell of the stables assault
your nose.  Horses stamp and shift in their stalls.  A fresh coat of varnish
covers the wooden walls and stall doors and a fresh red trim is painted
along the frame to the doors.  

The iron latches and hinges are oiled and glisten slightly.  Each door
swings open and closed without a squeek.  The ceiling is high enough to roll
a large wagon in with room to spare and to allow room for large horses who
go up on their hind legs to do so without hitting their head.  Hay is thrown
down from overhead into the stalls to keep the animals fed.

Inn Stables~
The back of the stables are as well kept as the front.  Fresh {ystraw{x covers
the stall floor and appears to be changed out regularly.  The Inn's horses
are kept at the back, two large work horses obviously strong enough to pull
a large wagon are kept in the back stalls, well cared for and groomed.  

The stall doors are all split doors, the bottom half coming up above the
waist, and the top half normally latched open so that the animals don't
become claustrophobic.

Stall~
This stall is kept as clean as can be done without spending every waking
moment scrubbing it down.  Fresh {ystraw{x covers the floor and clean food and
water are in the troughs spaced around the stall.  An extra horse blanket
is folded neatly and rests on a shelf at the back, along with the curry comb
and other supplies for tending to the animals.

Stall~
This is a large stall, meant for large animals.  Fresh straw covers the
floor and a trough with water is fastened against the outer wall.  Another
trough for holding the hay is fastened along the wall of the stall. 
Attempts to keep the mud of the city from taking over the stables are
combatted by always changing out the straw on the floor, so the aroma of
fresh straw is strong.  

Everything is kept as clean as possible, and the fresh paint on the walls
gives the stall an almost 'new' look.

Hayloft~
This open loft has only a thin beam of wood going around the edge to keep
anyone from falling off.  Large piles of hay are stored here for feeding the
animals below and a pitchfork for tossing the hay over the edge of the loft
and into the stalls rests up against the beam.  

The hay is piled up against the back wall, but trails of loose strands of it
are scattered along the edges of the loft where it has fallen during transit
to the stalls below.

Entrance to the Tavar~
The farmers market is usually one of the busier places in the city as
most of its citizens come here to shop.  Merchants call out to people about
their wares, hoping to make a sale while others let their wares do the
talking for them.

Long wooden planks are lined along the inside of this merchant's area. 
Large crates are stacked at the backs of the planks, each full to the brim
with fresh, dark-green limes.  To the front of the planks the limes are
spread out so the shoppers can look through the limes and pick the best.  An
elderly couple sit on a bench just inside the stall, watching as the
customers browse through their goods.

Large barrels and crates are scattered inside the stall, each filled with

testing it for ripeness before moving on to the next.  A small table has
been set up just inside the stall, a small, locked box resting atop it.  A
young girl is standing behind the table, watching the customers and
answering any questions they may have.

comes a very pleasant scent, even if it is a tad strong and the soft glow of
candle light.  The sign above the shop has a simple {Wca{Ynd{Wle{x upon it.  From
the north is the sounds of laughter and upon looking to the northern shop
one would notice {Wmajestic{x {Wm{Da{Wrb{Dl{We{x columns at the front of the shop, looking
to the sign, one would notice a {Yg{yo{Yl{yd{Ye{yn{x leaf sign with a single glass of {rw{Din{re{x
upon it.

pair of {Dbreeches{x.  To the south is a shop with no sign, though there is a
pleasant woman, standing out front holding samples of the {Wsoap{x her husband
makes.

There is a rich feel to this room when one enters, three of the walls are
an elegant {rb{Du{rrg{Du{rnd{Dy{x, the back wall has a single door off to one side, the
rest of the back wall is covered in an elegant looking {Ds{Wt{Don{De{x with an open
hearthed {rf{Ri{Yre{Dp{Yla{Rc{re{x for simmering the soups which are served here.  There are
two {Wchefs{x standing beside the hearth, watching the kettles above it.  Then
on the wall to ones left when they enter is a {Yo{ya{Yk{ye{Yn{x bar, glistening in the
dim candle light.  In each corner of the room is a {Wmagestic{x {Wm{Da{Wrb{Dl{We{x column. 


The {Yt{ya{Yb{yl{Ye{ys{x are spaced apart enough for the serving girls to flutter through
them with ease.  The chairs at the tables look very comfortable and inviting
to the weary shopper from Market Street.

A {rw{Rar{rm{x and inviting feel, the store front has many shelves and upon many

the shelves no occupied by the glowing candles are many small vials of what
appears to be essential oils, to drip on the candle for a stronger pleasing
scent from the candle.  Also allowing for the mixture of the scents in the
candle and the oil.  On a shelf behind the counter are {ybr{Ya{yss{x objects with a
carved {ywo{Dod{yen{x handle, to snuff out the candles.  There are also pegs on the
wall, holding the candles able to be purchased up by their wicks.

small vases, which looks like they could hold one, maybe two {Yf{Wl{Wo{Yw{We{Wr{Ys{x,
sitting farther back on the table are some larger vases, which could hold . 
Cconsiderably more {Yf{Wl{Wo{Yw{We{Wr{Ys{x.  There are many other objects on the tables,
made from {rc{yla{ry{x.  Then upon a table closest to the counter is some fine {BS{ce{Ca{x
{CFo{cl{Bk{x porcelian.

wrong area.

There are waste receptacles lining the alley walls, giving the perfect place

Thieves Hangout~
A rope ladder leads down into this hidden chamber, for those who may not
always be able to get a drink at the pubs and taverns above and perhaps for
them to find work.  The stench of the city, seems to be very much emphasized
down below the streets.  Those who frequent such a spot seem to be the type
who doesn't mind the stench.  The walls are covered with muck and some dark
spots decorate the walls, is it blood?  If so, no one down here would be
willing to admit to that.  There is a make-shift bar off to one side of the
room.

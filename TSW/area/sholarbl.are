man inn keeper master dagilar~
Master Dagilar~
A large man leans next to the kitchen doorway, waiting to serve you.
~
Master Dagilar stands with his arms folded across his ample belly.  His
once white shirt is stained with grease and sweat, as is his apron.  His
trousers are patched at the knees.  His thinning grey hair falls to his
shoulders in greasy strands.  His graying beard is remarkably well trimmed. 
He has a pipe firmly clenched in his teeth.  His eyes take in all that is
occurring in the common room occasionally barking out orders to the serving
girls.

A {Rg{ra{Wt{we{Dg{wu{Wa{rr{Rd{x scans the incoming crowd.
~
Standing tall and silent, this man is one of many that are responsible
for the safety of the city gates.  Dark brown hair is worn in the
traditional Arafellin braids, just the very tips of each visible sticking
out from under his helmet.  Large brown eyes peer over the incoming traffic,
scanning for any possible threats or for any that need assistance.  Garbed
in light chain-mail and leather pants and boots with the hilt of a sword
visible behind each shoulder, he is ready for immediate action.

Orin, the {RC{ra{Wp{wt{Wa{ri{Rn{x of the {RG{ru{Wa{Rr{Rd{x stands here
~
A tall man with severe green eyes and light blonde hair braided into two
braids is here.  Small silver bells can be seen tied on the end of each
braid, which surprisingly makes no noise as he moves.  He's wearing his full
uniform with two swords strapped to his back and his ranks mark him as the
Captain of the Guard.  His face is serious, almost as if he's considering
something.

~
Dressed in chainmail that jingles softly as he moves, the stocky,
dark-haired man turns to face you.  His hair is worn in a pair of braids
with small silver bells attached to each one.  Over his chainmail shirt, he
wears a white tunic bearing three red roses and the rank emblem of sergeant.
Sticking out above his shoulders are a pair of hilts that are angled
outwards so their blades cross on his back.

A man rolling the dice is here.
~
At first glance you might mistake this man as a common laborer.  While
his clothes are similar to the men he is dicing with, his are of better
quality and cut, nor are they stained.  From his haggard expression and
couple of days growth on his chin you might think he had been at this game
for some time.  From the bulge in his pouch you can tell luck has been with
him.

A serving girl hustles around the bar.

The buxom lass hurries to all of her tables, taking orders and bringing
food and drink.  When she gets a chance she clears as many dirty dishes as
she can and dumps them in the kitchen.  Her dark hair is braided in typical
Arafellin style complete with bells, which jangle as she performs her
assigned tasks.  Her once white apron is stained with food and drink.

A Domani Merchant heads towards the market.
~
With her hair cut short just above her shoulders and her big black eyes
stalking men as if hunting for a husband or just company, this woman walks
around with her hips swaying lightly.  Her silk dress is made after the
Domani fashion and you can almost see through it even with the rich
embroidery in it.  She looks like a merchant and even her hunting eyes seem
sharp enough for good trade.

A Merchant's Guardsmen follows close behind her.
~
Crystal green eyes scan all who approach for signs of trouble.  This
robust man stands near to his Mistress, his stance is casual to an untrained
eye.  However, his hand never strays far from the hilt of his sword.  His
tunic seems bulky, but the gentle scraping of chain mail explains the bulk.

One of the local citizens dressed in non-descript clothing hovers in the
background as others bustle by.  A lingering glance at those who pass is
spared to size up the purse as the mark hurries on their way.  With an
occasional jostle here, a slight touch there, he smiles grimly as his
coffers fill.

his boots.  Three large silver chains adorn his coat denoting his rank.  A
rather large earring of golden webbing, the strands bearing pearls of
graduated size dangles from his right ear, while an emerald loop adorned
with diamonds dangles from his left.  A ring marking his standing in the

The man standing before you is huge.  Not only tall but overly large, his
shoulders seem to be two or three times those of a trained soldier and his
arms could be as thick as a tree trunk.  His hands are calloused from
working his days at the Smithy and he wears his long hair in two braids with
bells tied to the end of them.  His gruff expression and the sword he is
sharpening in his hands give the impression that he is not the type of man

A traveler heads to the inn.

Carrying saddlebags across his shoulders and rucksack in his hands, this
tired man trudges towards the nearest inn.  His dust and grime covered cloak

Several days' growth of stubble, the dark circles under his eyes, and the
unwashed odor emanating from him lend ample evidence of his recent
adventures.

woman staff cook~
one of the {Wco{yo{Wking sta{yf{Wf{x~
A member of the cooking staff prepares a meal.
~
Intent on her task, this young woman has little time for anything other
cooking, and the head cooks instructions.  Dressed in a white dress,
kerchief, and apron, she is indistinguishable from the rest of the kitchen
staff.  She adds spices and herbs to the dish she is preparing, sampling it
every so often, nodding her successes or frowning and adding more to it.

sounds to him.

An impatient Lord paces here.
~
A distinguished Lord paces impatiently in front a pair of plush divan. 
His head is separated into two braids that bear tiny gold bells down their
lengths.  Over both shoulders the hilts of his swords gleam slightly from
being freshly polished.  He wears a well-made jacket with his house symbol
etched into its lapels and more gold bells are found up the sleeves of it. 
His breeches are plain black leather to match his boots.  On his left hand
there is a ring that he unconsciously fiddles with.

A tall woman in a white and green shawl stands beside the king.
~
 A tall woman stands to the side of the King.  Her bright green eyes
regard the petitioners lazily, though one can notice she is taking in every
detail.  Her resemblance to the King is striking.  Were it not for her long
blond braided hair, and smooth, wrinkle free face she could be his sister. 
Her gown is of finely tailored silk, cut in the Arafellin fashion.  She
wears a pair of velvet slippers, and a white shawl with green fringe.  A
golden ring of a serpent biting its own tail can be seen on her right hand,
marking her as an Aes Sedai without mistake.

A muscular man keeps a watchful eye on everything going on around him.
~
This tall, blond man moves with catlike grace.  His features are harsh,
seeming carved from stone, and are only softened by his forked beard.  He
regards all he sees with his piercing, deep blue eyes.  Broad of chest and
wide of shoulder, his clothing clings to his body, revealing muscles
developed from years of practice and training.  He is wearing a
short-waisted coat of silk dyed a muted color.  Over his coat is a cloak
that blends into the throne room walls in a nearly nauseating fashion.  His
jewelry consists of three thick gold chains around his neck and a simple
hoop dangling from one ear.

Dressed in the red and white livery of the royal staff, this middle aged
woman is intent on her duty.  A long knife is sheathed on her hip.  Her gray
hair is pulled up tightly into a bun.  Her movements are deliberate, smooth,
almost graceful as she maintains the living quarters of visiting nobles and
the royal chambers.  Fine lines are beginning to form in the corners of her
dark eyes, though her face is unmarred with laugh lines.

to each one.  A long angry scar runs from his hairline above his left eye,
down across the bridge of his nose and disappearing behind his right ear. 
His right eye has a milky color of sightlessness.

close to his scalp.  His clothing, while finely tailored and of excellent
quality somehow manage to pass as something a bit less regal than would suit
a king.  Two hilts jut out from behind his shoulders causing his cape to
hang awkwardly.  His dark brown eyes rarely leave the woman beside him, and
then only to scan for any signs of danger.

Sittinging before you is a sturdy young woman.  Her auburn hair spills
freely over her shoulders.  Her eyes regard all before her with a sense of
innocence, yet there is a temper of callousness which living so close to the
blight generates.  Her dress is that of a simple Arafellin cut, but is made
of a silk that shimmers slightly as she moves.  At the hems of her dress is
embroidery of wolves and doves.  Sheathed on her hip rests a simple dagger,
the hilt worn smooth from practice.  Her only jewelry is a small diamond and
ruby bracelet.

Common Room of the White Stag Inn~
A smoky haze hangs over the large room.  The smell of stale ale and
spoiling food is overpowering.  Tables are littered with an assortment of
dirty dishes, and spilled drinks.  Serving girls rush about filling cups and
occasionally picking up the odd plate and cup to return to the kitchen.  A
group of men sit near the fire engrossed in a game of dicing.  A rickety
stairway leads up to the rooms.  There is a closed door east.

The Innkeepers Bedroom~
The room is only remarkable when compared to the disaster area of the
common room.  This room, though dark, is surprisingly clean and tidy.  The
only thing cluttered is the desk in the corner.  The bed sags a bit, but is
made to military standards.  The din from the common room is greatly muffled
with the door closed.

The Kitchen of the White Stag~
The aroma that comes from this room is heavily scented with herbs, spices
and roasting meats.  Roasted animal carcasses hang from hooks in the
ceiling, waiting to be served to the patrons.  There is a huge brick oven
used for roasting the meat.  Over the large blazing fire is a steaming pot
full of chili.  Dirty dishes are stacked by a pair of large casks.  The
clean dishes are stacked on a counter next to one of the casks.

The thick wall to the north rises high above offering the citizens a
sense of security from attacks.  The cobblestone road continues east towards
the Northwestern Tower.  To the west lies the North Gate.  The old building
to the south is two stories tall.  A fresh coat of whitewash has given it
new life.  Inviting aromas and lively sounds spill out into the street.

cobblestones are cracked and worn from years of passage.  Great stone steps
disappear up into the heights of the tower.  A couple of soldiers, just off
watch, are standing on the steps debating going to the White Stag Inn for a
quick meal.  A few merchants hurry by, intent upon their business.

The North Gate~
Heavy iron bars of the gate are built directly into the thick stone walls
of the city, giving protection as well as accessibility.  At night, a
portcullis is lowered, bolstering the gate's defenses.  The gate is watched
heavily, the guards ever vigilant for cloaked strangers or contraband.  The
road stretches in each direction.  East and west follow the North Wall. 
From the south, cries of the marketplace can be heard.  The road to the
north leads only to farms and then the Blight.

Rows of cots line the room.  Footlockers are placed at the end of each cot. 
Weapons and armor are neatly laid out for easy access should an alarm be
sounded.  Those not sleeping huddle in small groups dicing, telling war
stories, or repairing their tools of the trade.

Entering the Market Place~
The noise level increases drastically upon nearing the market place. 
Food, clothing, books and other assorted goods can be found here.  Hawkers
line the cobblestone road boasting of the value of their goods.  They
eagerly call you over to their carts and try to barter with you.  Further
south there are more shops and carts.  To the north is the gate leading to
the Blight.  A group of soldiers exit the door to the east as they begin
their patrol.

Along the Market Place~
A crowd of people flock along the road, sidestepping hawkers and other
shoppers, as they search for the perfect bargain.  A gentle breeze wafts the
mingled aromas of the various carts and shops creating a scent unique and
somehow pleasant.  Shops can be reached by squeezing between the carts. 
More permanent structures can be seen to the south.  To the north is an open
air market and the North Gate.

A thinning crowd of people walk along the cobblestone road.  There are no
carts or hawkers here, though their cries can be heard in the distance.  The
market place ends but you can see the entrances to three different shops,
each with a wooden sign hanging above their door.  To the west is the Copper
Thimble, to the east Gaia's Herbs, and to the south Jasmine's Book Emporium.
Soldiers pass through the crowd while patrolling the market.

Jasmine's Book Emporium~
Books line the walls of this shop.  The aisles are made up of several
bookshelves.  The musty smell of old tomes and scrolls is somehow
comforting.  A bell attached to the door jingles softly when the door is
opened or closed alerting the clerk to the arrival of a potential customer. 
A middle-aged woman sits behind the counter reading a book, she looks up as
the bell announces your arrival.

The shops large windows capture the sun's rays from early morning to late
afternoon allowing the herbs growing in the window to get the light they
need to grow.  The scent of fresh herbs and spices hang heavily in the air. 
The walls are lined with glass and wood cases, which hold numerous spices,
herbs, and dried leaves.  Towards the back of the shop is a counter. 
Resting on the counter are several mortars and pestles and several knives
and scissors.

are draped with patterns and cloth in various stages of what will soon
become clothing.  Behind the counter are several boxes of buttons and other
fasteners.  The large table in the center of the shop is used for measuring
and cutting of fabric.  There are several pieces of chalk, scissors,
measuring tapes, pins and needles scattered on one corner of the table.  A
small stool is set to the side of the counter.

The Knick and Knack Brick and Brack Shoppe~
This mercantile is spotless.  The freshly plastered walls and stained
wooden counter suggests an owner that likes his things in order, without
dust or dirt.  A large jar on the counter holds a wide selection of bells,
suitable for one's hair.  Next to the jar are small boxes for customers to
set their selections in.

The Bare Essentials~
The scent of fresh cut wood tinged with the scent of varnish fills the
air.  Chairs, stools, benches, tables, and chests are carefully displayed
with the more intricately carved items in the windows to catch the eye of a
passing customer.  Towards the back of the shop are various pieces of
furniture in different states of repair.  Behind the counter a young man
sets down his chisel as the door opens.  He turns his head away from his
carving and smiles at the new arrival.

The Open Air Market~
Stalls and carts make up the rows of this market.  Shoppers stroll along
the rows looking for a good bargain.  Hawkers cry out to anyone near to
entice them and to try to persuade them of the value of their goods.  Most
of the items for sale here are homegrown or handcrafted.  The air is filled
with the jumbled sounds of bartering and haggling over prices, and of sales
made and lost.  The presence of patrolling soldiers lends a sense of
security to all who shop here.

A Hidden Passage~
The large hallway stretches towards the west.  The ceiling raises high
above, lanterns are evenly spaced every few feet keeping the hallway well
lit.  The odor of horses and fodder permeate the passage and mingle
unpleasantly with tallow burning in the lanterns.

The Dented Cuirass~
This well-lit store has numerous amounts of armor surrounding the walls. 
The wall showing between the pieces of armor, shield and the like appears to
be plaster.  On the wall behind the counter is an old cuirass, a large dent
is apparent where the wearers heart would be.  The light comes from oil
lamps around the store.  Behind the counter sits a robust man, mending a
piece of armor.  He sets the armor aside and stands, as he hears the tinkle
of the bell that is set above the door.

Before the West Gate~
Heavy iron bars of the gate are built directly into the thick stone walls
of the city giving protection as well as accessibility.  At night a
portcullis is lowered, bolstering the gate's defenses.  The gate is watched
heavily, the guards ever vigilant for cloaked strangers or contraband.  The
road leads to Kandor, and Chachin.

cobblestones are cracked and worn from years of passage.  Great stone steps
disappear up into the heights of the tower.  A couple of soldiers, just off
watch, are standing on the steps debating going to the Inn for a quick meal.
A few merchants hurry by, intent upon their business.

the side of the building, empty crates and firewood are neatly stacked.  The
road east seems to end abruptly in a dead end.  To the west stands the city

A Dead End~
Caught in the shadow of the large building to the northwest, and the
market place to the east, little natural light filters here.  Judging from
the piles of spoiled food and discarded clothing, many of the locals use
this place as a dump.  The rancid stench of spoiled food, vomit and urine is
nearly overpowering.  Once a week, soldiers facing discipline are given the
task of burning the piles and disposing of the ash.

continues to the north where many of the newcomers will gaze up at the Keep
of Shol Arbela.  A sign marker at the corner of the street also indicates
there is an inn to the south and west.  A number of the people with
traveling packs can be seen walking in that direction.  The Gate lies just
to the south.  The odors of horses and hay are prevalent here.  To the east
is the Hoof and Tackle Stables.  To the west lie the South Barracks. 
Soldiers exiting the barracks begin their vigil of keeping the peace.

Hoof and Tackle~
The scent of molten metal assaults one's senses.  The sound of hammer
ringing upon anvil causes one's heart to match the rhythm.  The heat
permeates the skin causing discomfort, while the eyes burn from the smoke
emanating from the forge.  Metal objects lining the walls reflect the orange
and red light from the forge.

Upon entering this stable one hears and feels the striking of metal upon
metal coming from the north.  Under these rhythmic tone's one hears the
neighing of horses.  The smell that rises to ones nostrils are the scents of
horse and hay with an undertone of oil and smoke.  The stalls on both the
left and right are filled with horses, both draft and riding.  The wooden
walls of the stalls are covered with leather straps, crops, saddles,
bridles, and other riding paraphernalia.

Along the South Wall~
The thick wall to the south rises high above offering the citizens a
sense of security from attacks.  Footsteps clatter on the worn cobblestones
of the road as you pass a few citizens, travelers and the ever vigilant
soldiers walking their patrol.  Directly to the east, a tower rises high
above the wall.  Far to the west another tower can be seen.  The door to the
north has carved sabers crossing over a bunch of grapes.  The aroma of stew
and the rowdy sounds people having a good time waft invitingly into the
street.

The Southeastern Tower~
Archways lead away from the tower to the north and west.  The
cobblestones are cracked and worn from years of passage.  Great stone steps
disappear up into the heights of the tower.  A couple of soldiers, just off
watch, are standing on the steps debating going to the Crossed Sabers for a
quick meal.  A few citizens hurry by, intent upon their business.

smooth through years of passage.  From here, the watch keepers have an
unobstructed view of any who approach, be they traveler, merchant, or enemy.
A slate shingled eave offers a small bit of protection from the elements. 
Two soldiers keep a silent vigil.

The objects in this house have come from many nations.  Everything seems
to have been placed in the best possible way to display it, lending a
surreal sense of the house being more showroom than domicile.  The
furniture, vases and paintings are obviously high quality and made by the
best craftsmen and artisans.  While there is wood in the fireplace, it is
void of ash, and the hearth is cold.

ends here, but back to the west, the stairway to the common room can be

warmth though no one would dare to make themselves too comfortable in a room
full of expensive porcelain.  A stairway can be seen in the back of the room
leading probably to a bedroom.  To the west a large room can be seen.

offers poor illumination.  On the shelves are an assortment of home
preserved fruits and vegetables, spices and herbs.  Two barrels rest in
opposite corners, one containing apples, and the other potatoes.  Built into
the back wall is a wine rack full of the innkeeper's homemade vintages.

bustling with activity.  The aromas of the daily special hang heavily in the
heat.  A large table dominates the center of the kitchen where young
assistants prepare the daily specials under the watchful eye of the
Innkeeper's wife.  Older assistants tend to the pots simmering on the stove
and the bread baking in the oven.  The Innkeeper's daughter is watching the
pheasant roast on a spit over the fire.

traded from a merchant or Seafolk.  A beautiful chair is placed near the

are black.  The different colors of roses seems to draw a pattern that could
amuse the eye of a good observer.  Benches were placed so people could sit
down and enjoy their time here.  The songs of birds mingle softly with the
sound of the cool water from the stone fountain at the center of the garden.

The Bedroom~
This bedroom is decorated with a sleigh bed and rugs made of animal fur,
a wardrobe and nightstand, all made of quality wood.  Thick tapestries line
the walls, lending much needed insulation in the winter and summer months. 
The few vases are of slightly lesser quality than those in the main room of
the house.  A window on the east wall allows morning sunlight to wake the
occupant at dawn.

{DC{yr{Do{ys{Ds{ye{Dd {DS{wa{Dbe{wr{Ds{x Tavern~
The mural on the walls dominates this bar.  It tells a story in stages of
an Arafelan man successfully defending his family from a trolloc attack. 
The mural is separated by two impossibly large crossed sabers, which are
attached to the wall behind the bar.  Several tables are strategically
placed around the fire pit, others line the walls offering a bit more
privacy.  Serving women move from table to table taking orders and bringing
libations.

Back of a Large Warehouse~
This building is used for emergency population overflow in event of an
attack.  Stacks of broken down cots, sacks of grain, and blankets are lined
up along the walls in neat rows for quick and easy access.  Casks of water
are strategically placed along the walls.  In the center of this room is a
large fire pit where families unfortunate enough to find themselves billeted
here may cook their meals.

A Path to the {DK{wee{Dp{x~
Rose hedgerows obscure the thick stone wall which separates the city of
Shol Arbela from the Keeps grounds.  The cobblestone road runs north and
south and is obstructed only in the event of attack by heavy wood and steel
gates, which normally stand open allowing free access to the keep.  From the
north the sound of running water can just be heard.  The way south leads
back into the city.

A Massive Larder~
Stretching back as far as the eye can see this stone hewn room is really
more a cavern than anything else.  Running the lengths of the northern and
western walls are massive shelves extending from floor to ceiling.  The
shelves to the north are filled with herbs, spices, and preserves.  The
western wall is more a giant wine rack.  Along the southern wall are barrels
filled with grains and other dry goods, ales, and pickled fruits and
vegetables.  Several long tables have been placed to create a sectioning of
the room.  Placed on the tables are aging cheeses, breads, dried meats, and
fruits.  Suspended from the ceiling near the center of the room are numerous
carcasses of cattle, sheep, and various fowl.

The War Room~
A large table lined by high-backed chairs sits at the center of this
somber room.  The walls are lined with lanterns that are constantly kept lit
and maps of the surrounding countryside.  Different colored lines mark the
boundaries on the maps and show the constant encroachment of the Blight from
the north.

The Receiving Room~
Single chairs and divans are placed strategically around this large room
allowing for private conversations or solitary contemplation as people wait
for an audience with the King or Queen.  Lending warmth and providing a
dampening effect, thick vibrant tapestries cover the walls.  A tall
parchment strewn stand near the doorway leading back into the hall is used
by the Chamberlain to keep track of the order of petitioners.

The {RT{rh{Wro{rn{Re R{Woo{Rm{x~
This large room is dominated by the starkly carved wooden chair that sits
atop a dais near the back wall of the room.  Richly decorated tapestries
hang along the walls, depicting glorious battles against the Shadow, and
giving an illusion that the room is somehow smaller than it is.  Chairs and
stools are lined up, creating a sort of path for people approaching the
throne to walk.  Torches and lanterns are kept constantly lit, banishing
shadows from the room.  A small door is tucked into a corner leading off
from the Throne Room.

Sitting Room~
The lighting in here is not as harsh as the Throne Room, but no hint of a
shadow is allowed, lest the Shadow find a way to winnow its way into the
Keep.  The furnishings are both less grand and more comfortable than the
main room, but the sofa and chairs are covered in brocades as richly colored
and patterned as those in the Throne Room.

Though a corner, this part of the corridor is still wide enough to allow
two men in full armor standing abreast to fight unencumbered by the others
presence.  Whitewashed stone slabs stretch from floor to ceiling, merging

treatises line three of the whitewashed walls.  Mirrored stand lamps are
positioned safely between the bookcases.  A writing table rests in the
middle of the room, while overstuffed chairs are placed carefully about the
room offering privacy or casual discourse.  Tapestry covered doors lead east
and west.

A Well Lit Corridor~
Continuously lit oil lamps keep the corridor well illuminated, and are
evenly spaced between colorful tapestries.  The hallway is wide enough to
accommodate two men in full armor standing abreast and still allow them to
fight unencumbered by the others presence.  Large whitewashed stone slabs
stretch from floor to ceiling, merging seamlessly, giving the illusion of
being carved out of a single stone.  The door to the south bears a hand
carved frieze depicting two lovers picnicking along the Mora River.

most of the room.  Well-crafted candelabras provide direct light and cast

The Warden's Office~
The room is best described as functionally cramped.  A large desk that
takes up the majority of the office faces the heavy wooden door.  A small
chest of drawers is crammed into a corner behind the desk.  Standing in the
other corner behind the desk is a thick wooden pole with various hooks,
which are used for holding the Wardens weapons and armor.  A solitary
hardback chair rests in the corner near the door leaving a tight path around
the desk.  The walls, once whitewashed, are now a dull grey.

The Interrogation Room~
The sickly sweet scent of fear and sweat seems to seep from the walls. 
Patches of whitewash are spackled around the room but dark stains still
bleed through.  A solitary stool stands in the center of the room.  Pincers,
pliers, and needles are secured to the wall near a glowing brazier for quick
and easy use.  Over the years soot and smoke have left an everlasting smear
over the brazier.  Shackles are permanently secured so high up on the wall
that even a very tall mans feet would not rest on the floor.

Heavy cold stone walls close in oppressively.  When the heavy wood and
steel door is shut it blocks out most of the sounds coming from the corridor
and other cells.  The only items in the cell are a thin straw mattress and a
pail.  A small slit midway up the door allows the passage of food and water.
Near the top of the door is a small window with a door, which opens only
from the outside, which allows the guards a clear view of the cell.

which is stained a reddish brown.  The floor around the block is stained the
same color.  A large double-headed axe hangs on the far wall, removed only
when it is required, and then only by the executioner.

a wooden door, which servants are continuously going in and out of as they
go about their business.

A Bustling Kitchen~
The head chef oversees the controlled chaos of meal preparation in her
expansive kitchen occasionally barking a sharp command or sampling the
dishes.  Pots of broths and sauces simmer on a sizable stove as young men
slice and dice vegetables in preparation of adding them to the stocks. 
Several women knead dough, rolling it into fist-sized balls for rolls,
setting them on cooking trays.  An older man shuttles the trays into an
earthen oven for baking, while two young women turn a rotund pig roasting on
a spit over a crackling fire.

Several benches, chairs, and tables are scattered around the community area
where the men discuss the daily gossip while playing Snakes and Foxes or
repair various items for the Keep.  Standlamps and torches placed high on
the walls offer sufficient illumination.  Several mirrors line the wall near

The Attic~
The low ceiling makes it difficult for most adults to stand upright. 
Light filters in through tiny windows illuminating the dust that floats in
the air.  The illusion of a path stops around the first big box.  If it is
possible, there seems to be more junk crammed into this area.  Hastily
discarded boxes have been upturned, their contents dispersed haphazardly.

The Attic~
The low ceiling makes it difficult for most adults to stand upright. 
Light filters in through tiny windows illuminating the dust that floats in
the air.  The clutter that was so prevalent by the stairs is missing here. 
A mattress made up as a bed lies near the window.  A stump of a candle is
set near the mattress.

A Warm Kitchen~
The aroma that comes from this room is heavily scented with herbs, spices
and roasting meats.  A large table dominates the center of the kitchen where
the cook prepares the meals.  The south wall is dominated by a huge {rbr{wi{rck{x
oven and stove.  Along the east wall a sink and draining rack butt up to a
ladder.  Casks, kegs, and bottles line the west wall.

A Loft~
The combined din from the kitchen and tavern floor is at times deafening.
The oppressive heat from the kitchen and the fire pit keep the loft livable
in winter, and unbearable in warmer months.  A small bed on the east wall,
is neatly made.  A dowel running along the west wall provides a place to
hang cloaks and dresses.  A small chest of drawers stands by the ladder.

Roses of all sizes and colors grow around from white to a dark red that
one could almost swear they are black.  The different colors of roses seems
to draw a pattern that could amuse the eye of a good observer.  Benches were
placed so people could sit down and enjoy their time here.  The songs of
birds mingle softly with the sound of the cool water from the stone fountain
at the center of the garden.

carved into the ground to provide a safe place to store water and dry goods,
along with handful of candles.  Several blankets are rolled up in the

The loft is divided into two sections by a curtain.  This section is
obviously meant for the children of the house.  This seems to be the only
area in the house where order can not be enforced.  Several straw filled
mattresses lie haphazardly around the room, surrounded or covered with cast
off clothing and hand made toys.

This part of the loft is obviously for the parents.  The straw filled
mattress is set against the far wall.  Clothes hang from a dowel, which has
been attached to the walls running parallel to the dividing curtain.  It
serves as much as a noise dampener as functioning as the families closet.

herbs and spices.  The north wall is covered with hooks for the various pots
and pans.  A large butcher block takes up the center of the room.

rack.  Along the southern wall are barrels filled with grains and other dry
goods, ales, and pickled fruits and vegetables.  Several long tables have
been placed to create a sectioning of the room.  Placed on the tables are
aging cheeses, breads, dried meats, and fruits.  Suspended from the ceiling
near the center of the room are numerous carcasses of cattle, sheep, and
various fowl.

The Practice yard~
The large uneven field was at one time completely grass covered.  Years
of marching, and other drills have worn several patches to hard-packed dirt.
Targets for lances and bows spot the far end of the field, while man sized
dummies line the length of it.  A raised platform used for viewing the
troops stands off to the side of the northern barracks.  Several soldiers
are going through their paces under the watchful eyes of their Sergeants and
Officers.

north east corner of the room.  A pair of over stuffed chairs are separated
by a small table sit before the fireplace.  A large pile of wood is stacked
neatly beside the fireplace ready to be used at the leisure of anyone using
the room.  Several stand-lamps are placed around the room, ready to be lit
at dusk.  A thick plush carpet covers most of the floor, leaving the space
before the fire a barren slate.

piece parchment~
This is a torn piece of {wp{yarchmen{wt{x upon which are written the following
words...  

There are four stone statues called "guardians" located in the catacombs
underneath the city.  Also hidden underneath the city are several orbs. 
Both the orbs and the guardians appear to be some sort of ter'angreal, each
orb can activate any of the guardians.  Inserting the correct orb unlocks
part of some sort of device hidden beneath the city whilst inserting an
incorrect orb initiates a defensive mechanism.  I have managed to deduce the
following pairs:

{DRed Orb ----> Axe{x
{DYellow Orb -> Sword{x
{DBlue Orb ---> Trident...{x

{YJehannah Gate{x~
Jehannah Gate is named after the trade road that leads northwards through
this gate, linking Amador with Ghaeldan's capital city.  The gate is a
massive archway that is approximately twenty feet in height and has been
built into the thick gray stone walls that surround and protect the city.  A
wide tree lined avenue leads northwards past tall gray buildings and grassy
green areas of parkland towards the center of the city.  A massive gray and
white stone fortress stands at the center of Amador, the infamous Fortress
of the Light.

This is a huge square that has been paved with the same pale gray
lustrous stone as the roads of the city.  The square is flanked along all
sides by tall houses and shops built using gray brick and stone and crowned
with roofs tiled with dark slate.  The massive defensive wall that encircles
the city can be seen from here, a wide tree-lined avenue goes northwards
from this square towards a huge yet elaborately carved arched gateway that
leads out of the city.

The roads of Amador have been paved with a strange pale gray stone with a
purplish tint that looks slick and yet provides a firm footing.  This
particular road is overlooked by two neat rows of shops; each of these tall
buildings is a remarkable construction of bluish-gray stone with an ornately
carved facade and topped with a steeply sloping roof tiled with dark gray
slate.  A large plaza can be seen just a short distance away to the west
from this point.

Amador is a maze-like system of roads that are paved with an odd pale
gray stone with a bluish-purple tint that looks like as slick as ice and yet
provides good traction.  This particular road bends sharply at this point as
it follows the immense walls that surround the city.  The road is overlooked
by two neat rows of shops; each of these tall buildings is a remarkable
construction of grayish-blue stone with an ornately carved facade and topped
with a steeply sloping roof tiled with dark gray slate.  A wide lane cuts
through the row of buildings on the north side of the road, leading to a
small cobblestone yard.

Fletcher's Road~
Amador is a labyrinth-like network of roads that are flanked by tall
buildings of varying shades of gray.  The stone used to pave the streets is
rather peculiar, it is pale gray almost white in color but the tiny crystals
that make up the rock's surface shine with a faint bluish-purple gleam as
they catch the light.  This particular road is overlooked by neat rows of
shops constructed from bluish-gray stone with an ornately carved facade and
a steeply sloping roof tiled with dark gray slate.

This is a very narrow alleyway that cuts between two rows of buildings. 
Like the roads of Amador, this alley has been paved with grayish-white
crystalline stone that looks smooth and yet provides a firm footing.  The
buildings that flank this alley are a hodgepodge of brick and stone although
all of these structures have roofs that are covered with dark slate tiles. 
To the west the alley joins with a wide thoroughfare that encircles a tall
stone fortress built at the center of the city.

Farrier's Road~
Amador is a maze-like network of roads that are overlooked by tall
buildings of varying shades of gray.  The stone used to pave the streets is
rather peculiar, it is pale gray almost white in color but the tiny crystals
that make up the rock's surface shine with a faint bluish-purple gleam as
they catch the light.  The slabs look as slick as ice and yet they provide
firm traction for all of the roads' users.

Fortress Road bends sharply at this point as it almost completely
encircles the Fortress of the Light, the headquarters of the Children of the
Light.  The road has been built using a smooth crystalline stone that is
off-white in color and develops a bluish-purple tint as light hits it.  The
Fortress is overlooked from the opposite side of the road by clusters of
shops, houses and warehouses linked together with a network of narrower

This is a wide road that almost completely encircles the immense hulking
structure of white and gray stone that lies in the center of Amador, the
Fortress of the Light.  This man-made wonder almost equals the sheer scale
of Ogier-crafted projects yet its simplicity holds within it a strange
attractiveness.  The Fortress is overlooked from the opposite side of the

This large windowless office is used by to one of the officers of the
Hand of the Light.  The walls and floor of this square room have been built
from pale gray stone and the area is brightly illuminated using mirrored
stand-lamps set in the four corners.  A wide fireplace carved from dull gray
stone has been built into the east side of the room; a large clock housed
inside a walnut case sits upon the mantelpiece.  The tall arched door braced
with iron on the east side of the office appears to be this room's only

This interrogation room is a rather large room that is roughly square in
shape.  Both the pale gray stone walls and flagstone floor of this room feel
cold and slightly damp; the only fixtures noticeable upon the walls are
thick iron rings that are probably used to attach shackles to.  The only
source of light in this windowless room appears to be the tiny space
underneath the cell's reinforced door on the south.  The ceiling of this
chamber has been vaulted, the acoustics within this room are so good that
even the smallest whisper can be heard clearly anywhere inside the room.

This is a large chamber on the basement level of the Fortress of the

walls of this room were constructed from pale gray stone and rock of a
similar shade of gray has been used to pave the floor.  A strong stench of
mothballs permeates the area.  There are dozens of shelves attached to the
walls and racks lined up neatly in rows at the center of the chamber; they
all appear to have been made from oak wood.  A tall doorway at the west side
of the room appears to be the only exit from here.

diameter and fifty paces in height at its apex.  Gold leaf covers the
ceiling of the Dome, reflecting the light of one thousand hanging lamps. 
White marble tiles cover the floor and thick white marble columns ring the
chamber, plain yet polished till gleaming.  The pillars have been placed
inside the chamber for decorative purposes as the dome can support its own
weight.  Behind these columns are smaller ones, between these columns are
alcoves decorated with frescoes depicting the history of the Children of the

This is the Golden Head, an inn often frequented by well-to-do travelers
and prosperous merchants.  This particular room is the common room, a large
rectangular room with teak wood paneling adorning its walls.  The floors
have also been given a coat of varnish although they seem somewhat sticky
from spilt drinks.  Despite this, the room has a warm and cozy feel to it
that is enhanced by the golden glow of the lanterns placed around the room
and the welcoming gray stone fireplace built into the north wall.

Metal cogs, gears and counterweights fill almost as much as this gray

against metal that the clock parts make as they move.  The most impressive

in each of the four walls of the chamber filled with beautifully made
stained glass which cast a veil of colored light over the area.  A steep

luminous grease has been used to draw a symbol upon the stalagmite.

{cAn Underground Resevoir{x~
A large fresh water reservoir occupies this huge underground chamber. 
Part of the cavern looks like it has been formed from natural erosion but
there are tool marks upon some of the rock faces that indicate that some
work has been done to the area.  At the north end of the chamber is a
partially submerged tunnel that leads upwards to higher ground.

This is a deep channel of water that lies underground.  The waterway
occupies a vast cavern that was formed from the erosion of pale gray rock. 
Huge stalactites hang down from the cave's ceiling, some hanging just a few
inches above the surface of the water.  The cavern opens out to the east
where a large lake or reservoir can be seen.

This is a large rocky ledge that overhangs an underground river or

been created out of a pale gray, almost white stone that has been eroded by

the north by constructing a wall made of dark gray stone blocks; a doorway
set in the center of the wall appears to be the only way through.

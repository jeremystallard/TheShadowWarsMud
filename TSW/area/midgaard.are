an odd lock of grey hair standing out on the left side of her face.  Dark
{ybrown{x eyes sparkle with mischief while her full {rred{x lips remain in a pouty
smile.  Her {bblue{x and {yg{Yol{yd{x ensemble both hugs and flows about her.  A dipping
neckline shows ample cleavage, the tight {bbo{Bdi{bce{x showing an hour glass figure
and a slender waist while the flared skirt swirls and clings against her
legs.  A sash of {yg{Yol{yd{x silk hangs off her hips and down the middle of the
skirt, intricate embrodiery bringing out details on the sash.

    To whom it may concern,

        Merc Industries has installed a new no-rent save and quit
        system.  Apparently one can now save and quit at any time
        from anywhere inside a town or out.  My services here are
        no longer required.

    To whom it may concern,

        Merc Industries has charmed your money.  Apparently one's
        gold will remain close, even beyond death. We are closing
        down our offices and ATM machines.  Our services here are
        no longer required.

its namesake, City Park.

riverbanks are far too steep to climb.

This East Wall Road, a broad yet unpaved and dusty road that follows
alongside the eastern wall of Lugard.  Even from this point the wall appears
to be totally useless in the means of defense; it looks vaguely more like a
loosely held pile of rubble than an actual wall.  It seems that the people
of Lugard have simply continued to build their city around the old defensive
walls rather than demolish them.

{yWest Wall Road{x~
West Wall Road is a broad and unpaved street that follows along the
inside of the western wall of Lugard.  Remnants of older walls can be seen
inside the city as the locals have built around the ruins rather than
completely remove them.  A variety of buildings can be seen lining the
streets including warehouses, shops and taverns dotted amongst the citizens'
abodes.

The northwestern corner of Lugard is marked by a tall stone tower built
into the city wall.  A broad thoroughfare follows around the inside of the
city wall, curving sharply where it meets the foot of the tower.  In the
distance to the south is the Inishlinn Gate and to the east is the Mindea
Gate.

{DInside The Mindea Gate{x~
A pair of tall stone towers surrounds a heavy timber gate set into the
city wall beneath which lies a broad stone bridge connecting the roads of
the inner city to the roads outside.  The towers appear to be among the
sturdiest parts of the city's defenses; the city wall has been left in a
state of disrepair and would not be able to fare well against an attack. 
There is not much else of interest here apart from a road leading southwards
from the gate towards a busy marketplace.

The Mindea Gate is northernmost entrance into the walled city of Lugard
and is marked by two small towers flanking a heavy timber gate.  The gate
bars the way across a wide bridge crossing a dry moat built around the city.

nature of the Silver Pig Inn.

The attic is filled with the usual odd collection of boxes and furniture
but with the amount stacked up around the trap door it is hard to tell just
how large the room really is.  The only space in the boxes is to the left of
the ladder and it is just large enough for a mid-sized person to fit
through.  Oddly beige carpeting covers the floors, muffling sound and with
the color it is difficult to tell just how dusty the floor really is,
although a good coating of dust seems to have settled on the boxes.

{DInside The Shilene Gate{x~
Two tall stone towers flank a heavy wooden gate built into the city wall
beneath which lies a broad stone bridge linking the roads of the inner city
to the roads outside.  The towers seem to be among the sturdiest parts of
Lugard's defenses; the city wall has been left in a state of disrepair and
would not be able to withstand an attack.

{yWest Wall Road{x~
This is a broad, unpaved street that runs parallel to the inside of the
eastern wall of Lugard.  Pedestrians and wagons alike kick up clouds of dust
as they move around this gray and grimy city.  Various buildings can be seen
to the east including many shops but there is no direct route of access to
them from this point.

{yWest Wall Road{x~
This is West Wall Road, a wide and unpaved thoroughfare that follows
along the inside of the western wall of Lugard.  At this point within the
city two broad streets intersect each other perpendicularly, forming a
t-junction.  Both streets are overlooked by a variety of stark gray
buildings although the majority of the structures in this region are shops
and warehouses.

This is a wide yet unpaved street that leads east/west through the city. 
Most of the buildings within this district are constructed from dull gray
stone and have sloped roofs.  To the north is a leather shop, to the south
is a large warehouse and this street joins a second thoroughfare just a
short distance away to the west.

This street is part of the network of streets that cross the city of
Lugard.  Pedestrians, horses and vehicles alike kick up large amounts of
dust as they travel along this unpaved road.  On the north side of the
street is a pet shop whilst to the south is a levee.

{yEast Street{x~
This is a broad yet unpaved street that leads east/west through the city.
Numerous structures have been built along this road including a large
warehouse on the south side.  To the east this street intersects a second
thoroughfare that follows one of the many stone walls that once were a major
part of the city's defenses.  Even from this point the wall appears to be
totally useless in the means of defense, it looks vaguely more like a
loosely held pile of rubble than an actual wall.

This is a wide and unpaved road that follows along the inside of the
western wall of Lugard.  The road is split by the River Reisendrelle that
flows west through an opening in the wall approximately ten feet down.  At
this point a bridge built out from the city wall spans the waterway, linking
the sections of road together.

The common room of the Dancing Bear looks like any other common room. 
The room is bathed in a dull golden glow coming from lanterns hung from the
timber rafters.  At one end of the room is a blazing fireplace whilst facing
it at the opposite side is the bar.  Tables and benches have been neatly
arranged around the room with enough space between them to allow the serving
maids to move around them.

This is a man-made levee built along the northern bank of the River
Reisendrelle.  From here the river can be seen gently flowing westwards,
diving Lugard into two.  Directly across the river is a small boat landing
built off of the Riverside Diner.

{DAn Abandoned Warehouse{x~
This enormous gray stone building was once used as a warehouse.  The
place is very filthy and appears to have been unused for many years.  A
skylight in the roof above spills violet-tinged light across the empty
storage space.  The only exit from this deserted building appears to be the
set of double doors on the north side.

of Lugard have simply continued to build their city around the old defensive
walls rather than demolish them.

The Inishlinn Gate is westernmost entrance into Lugard and is marked by
two small towers flanking a heavy wooden gate.  The gate bars the way across
a broad bridge spanning a dry moat built around the city.  On this side of
the gate the bridge links to a broad dirt road that snakes its way westwards
through the grassy plains that surround Lugard towards Jehannah.

This is East Wall Road, a broad and unpaved street that follows along the
inside of Lugard's eastern wall.  Far from being an effective bastion, the
city walls have been left in a bad condition and have more in common with a
pile of rocks.  Remnants of older walls can be seen inside the city as the
locals have built around the ruins rather than demolish them completely. 
Just north of here is the Shilene Gate, the easternmost city gate.

that make a place livable are kept clean and in their places.

Just like its name suggests, three towers built into the city wall marks the
gateway, the center tower being the tallest and widest of the three.  A wide
road leads westwards through the gate, out of the city and towards an area
of hilly farmland and the Circuit of the Sun, one of Altara's famed
horseracing tracks.  To the east is the inner city whose maze of streets and
canals are often confusing for those unfamiliar with the city.

majority of the buildings in this area have their outer walls coated with a
layer of white plaster but there are a few buildings here that are
constructed using white stone instead.  The floral displays grown in window
boxes adorning some of these houses are almost as colorful as the distant
spires and domes of the city's palaces.

{WThe Intersection Of Crown Street And Brytan Street{x~
Two wide streets join each other at this point in the city.  Each of the
streets is flanked by tall houses that are either constructed from white
stone or covered with white plaster.  Some of the houses in this district
have been adorned with bright floral displays grown in window boxes.  The
glittering domes and spires of the city's palaces can be seen beyond the
forest of buildings that populate this district, adding bright splashes of
gold, red and blue to what would have been a dull skyline.

This bay is a vast stretch of water where the River Eldar flows out into
the Sea of Storms.  Situated along the western bank of the bay is the city
of Ebou Dar, a large cluster of white shops, houses, halls and palaces
although many of the larger buildings are crowned with towering spires and
golden domes.  On the eastern bank of the bay is the Rahad, a contrasting
area of slums with a name for corruption and greed.

This is the eastern bank of a vast bay where the River Eldar flows out
into the Sea of Storms.  This area is the home to numerous gray stone docks
where many ships are moored while more docks can be seen at the opposite
side of the bay.  However unlike the clusters of dilapidated buildings that
lie around the docks on the east side of the bay, the docks along the west
side has pristine white structures built around it.

This part of Dal Eira Park is a home to a small footbridge made of timber
that arches over a pond.  The muddy banks of the pond are covered with tall
reeds and densely growing shrubbery.  More clumps of reeds have sprung up at
the center of the pond close to the bridge as well as brilliant green lily
pads.  On either side of the bridge is a path made of gray slate that twists

This warehouse is an enormous gray stone structure that is approximately
square in shape with a low sloping roof.  The floor of the enclosure has
been paved with thick slabs of dull gray stone that are oddly shaped. 
Hundreds of wooden barrels and casks of varying sizes have been stacked
tidily within these four walls; each of the barrels appears to be branded
with symbols that denote each barrel's owner and contents.  Maybe the only
other thing of interest within this area is the pair of wide wooden doors at

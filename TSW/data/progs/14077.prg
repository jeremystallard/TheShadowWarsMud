sac letter
emote gets the letter disgruntedly and upon seeing the seal, excuses himself from the table and takes $n to a more deserted corner of the bar before he opens it. His eyes scan through the letter quickly before he nods.
emote glances around the bar to make sure no one is looking, then leans closer to whisper to $n.
mutter $n Alright. This guy she is after was causing a lot of trouble around here, specially with the ladies. But lately no one has seen him around and there is a rumor a High Lord by the name of Teneal got him. There is always a guard by his bedroom that will only let you go past if you wet his hand.
emote leans against the wall and says casually, '{GBut for less than you'd have to pay him, you can pay me and I will give you a little something.{x'

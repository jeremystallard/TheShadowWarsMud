<PRE><H1>Ghealdan Ghealdanin</H1>Small Ghealdan lies between Amadicia and Altara with its back against
Garen's Wall.  It is a relatively quiet and self-sufficient nation that is
ruled by either a King or a Queen who sits on the Light Blessed Throne. 
Ghealdan's greatest worry is possible conquest from Amadicia.  The rulers do
not seem to last long in Ghealdan and it is suspected that the Lords of
Ghealdan's High Crown Council have had a hand in removing the failed rulers.


Ghealdan's sigil is three silver stars arranged one above and two below... 
The Stars or the Silver stars, and the banner is the Stars on a field of
red.  The capital city is Jehannah and the symbol is the Light Blessed
Throne.

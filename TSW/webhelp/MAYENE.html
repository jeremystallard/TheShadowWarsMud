<PRE><H1>MAYENE MAYENER</H1>Mayene rests on the end of a peninsula in the Sea of Storms, hemmed in by
the looming bulk of Tear to the west and the Drowned Lands to the north.  It
is actually an independant city-state, rather than a nation, though Tear
claims it as a province despite Mayene's protests.  What fragile
independence Mayeners have is maintained through their one major asset, the
secret oilfish shoals.  The lamp oil produced from the oilfish here rivals
that from the olive groves of Tear, Illian, and Tarabon.  That oil is a
major source of Mayene's wealth and her fragile independence.  Despite
Tear's provincial claim, no Tairen knows where the oilfish shoals are
located, and the Mayeners are determined to keep it that way.  

The ruling family of Mayene claims to be descended from Artur Hawkwing, and
uses the Paendrag name.  The man or woman who rules Mayene is styled "the
First," which once meant the first lord or lady.  Originally there was also
a single "second" lord or lady, but over that last four hundred years the
tradition changed so that several lords and ladies held the title at once. 



Because of the constant threat from Tairen assassins, all the high lords and
ladies are trained in basic self-defense, so that they need not rely solely
on their personal guards for protection.  The city-state itself is protected
by the Mayener Winged Guards, the First's personal guard.  Their gleaming
red breastplates and red-streamered lances have been seen at the forefront
of many conflicts throughout the history of Mayene.  

Mayene's sigil is a golden hawk in flight, the Golden Hawk and her banner is
the Golden Hawk in flight on a field of blue.  It is sometimes called
Paendrag's Banner by Mayeners and is fringed in gold if flown where the
First is present.

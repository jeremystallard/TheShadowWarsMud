Cloaks have the ability to be wrapped around your body and thus hide your
equipment with the exception of those that are held or wielded.  To be able
to cloak yourself, you will need a cloak that is worn -about- body.  The
cloak should also have the keyword "cloak" in its short description or it
will not work.  

Cloaks also have the ability to fully conceal your appearance, using the
command known as hood.  The hood command will conceal you behind a cloak as
long as it has a hood.  

Before you can raise your hood, you need to set a hood appearance for your
self.  The hood appearance needs to have the following keywords in it: 

</FONT><FONT COLOR="goldenrod">Keyword</FONT> 1.) </FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Hooded</FONT> or </FONT><FONT COLOR="white">hood</FONT>.
</FONT><FONT COLOR="goldenrod">Keyword</FONT> 2.) </FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Figure</FONT> or </FONT><FONT COLOR="white">creature</FONT>.

Example: hoodapp A hooded figure

Using the '</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">hoodappearance</FONT>' command without an argument will simply display the
short string of the hooded cloak that you are wearing about your body.  
 
To uncloak and unhood, retype the commands again. They will toggle the option.

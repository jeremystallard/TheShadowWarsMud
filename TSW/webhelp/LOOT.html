<PRE><H1>LOOT LOOTING</H1>Syntax: loot <object> <victim>

Looting objects from people is to be done ONLY In Character.  

When you mug someone, and you really want something of theirs, and you have
put them past the point of caring at the moment whether you take it or not
(read subdued them), you may take what you desire with the loot command.  

The exceptions to looting being done IN Character is if you are attacked and
you subdue your opponent, or if you are retaliating for a prior incident. 
If you antagonize someone, there is now something that can be done.

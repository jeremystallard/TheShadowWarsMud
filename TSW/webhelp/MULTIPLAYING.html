<PRE><H1>MULTIPLAYING ALT ALTS</H1>ALLOWS MULTIPLAYING - MEANING THAT YOU ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE
PLAYER ON LINE AT A TIME - </FONT><FONT COLOR="red">BUT NO MORE THAN 2</FONT>.  HOWEVER, THE RULES BELOW ARE
THE SAME.  YOUR PLAYERS SHOULD HAVE NO INTERACTION WHATSOEVER.  FOR EXAMPLE,
THEY CAN BE ONLINE LEVELING AT THE SAME TIME, BUT THEY CAN NOT BE LEVELING
TOGETHER.  

THE IMMORTALS AT TSW ALSO STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO RESPECT ROLEPLAY,

* Using one character to get anything (eq, gold, etc.)  For another
character - such as dropping it or giving it to another person to hold,
logging off, logging on another character, and picking it up/getting it from
someone.  Rule of thumb: If one of your characters has touched the item(s)
or gold, then your other characters aren't allowed to.  This also includes
going linkdead with one char, logging on another to give items/gold, or
weave on the linkdead character.  

* Your characters should be completely separate entities.  They should have
no knowledge of another through your doing.  Sometimes you may hear of your
other characters activities through RP, but overall you should stay out of
RP your alts are involved in.  This includes RP-ing your alt's family or
friends - this is not allowed.  Do not allow any interacting RP between
characters if possible, if it becomes too entangled, it will be up to the
Admin to determine if any wrongdoing has been committed.  Any judgement
handed down will lean strongly toward multiplaying for the good of the
entire mud, so it is wise if you use extreme caution as well.  

* No one else may play, or be in control of your character.  You are
responsible for any action your character engages in, and no excuse of lost
passwords or roomates logging into your character will suffice.  If you do
not want to lose your character, then ensure that no one has access to it. 

* Just to make it clear: Using one character to assist another IN ANY WAY,
is multiplaying and punishable by deletion.  ALTS SHOULD -NEVER- BE IN THE
SAME ROOM TOGETHER, FOR ANY REASON.  

At this time, you should only have 1 major character at a time unless one of
them is granted.  This includes such things as only 1 Aes Sedai in the White
Tower.  Only 1 Guild Leader, etc.  If you are in such a position, you should
dedicate your time to developing your character and helping the guild that
you are a part of.

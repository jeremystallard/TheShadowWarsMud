<PRE><H1>GRANTS GRANTED GRANT</H1>Granted characters are characters given to mortals by the Immortals. 
Granted characters usually play a crucial role in the RP so it's important
for the player with a granted character to put in at least 10 hours every
week where he or she will be promoting RP. 
 
Asking for a granted character is the easiest way to NOT get one.  The
Immortals will decide among themselves if a player should or should not have
a granted character.  Abusing the powers of a granted character may have the
granted character taken from you as well as not logging on for the amount of
time determined by the Immortals (10 hours/week at least).
 
Granted characters are a privilege and not a right.  The Immortals may
revoke such privilege as they see fit.  The granted character should be the
character receiving most attention from the player for that reason having an
alternate guildleader when you have a granted character is discouraged.

<PRE><H1>TARABON TARABONER</H1>Tarabon is nominally ruled jointly by a king and a panarch, who are both
elected by the Assembly of Lords.  The King and the Panarch are equal in
authority.  The Panarch collects taxes, customs, and duties, controls the
Civil Watch, and oversees the lower courts.  Her personal guard is the
Panarch's Legion.  The King is responsible for spending the collected
revenue properly, controls the army, and oversees the High Court.  His
personal guard is the King's Life Guard.  The only major political duty of
the Assembly of Lords is the election of both King and Panarch.  

In Tarabon, it is considered impolite to completely reveal one's face except
when eating or drinking.  As a result, both men and women wear a transparent
veil across the face.  When anonymity is required, they may even don a mask
to completely cover the features.  

Taraboner men often sport facial hair under the veil in the form of a thick
mustache, and wear a dark cylindrical cap on their thick dark hair.  Both
lords and commoners wear baggy white trousers and coats embroidered with
scrollwork on the shoulders, though the lords' coats are usually of finer
material and their much more elaborate embroidery is often gold. 
Loose-fitting shirts with embroidered chests are worn under the coats. 
Occasionally trousers are embroidered as well.  

Noblewomen veil their faces, but they do not believe in hiding their
figures.  Most wear clinging gowns of thin silk that are almost as revealing
as those worn by Domani women.  Peasant women also prefer thin fabric,
though their dresses are usually made out of drab wool, quite coarse in
comparison to their betters'.  

Household servants wear wool, but of a finer quality than that available to
most peasants, with the sigil of the House embroidered on the breast.  

Tarabon's sigil is a golden tree with a thick bole and spreading branches
balanced by the roots below, the Golden Tree, and the banner is the Golden
Tree on a field of vertically striped red and white, four red and three
white.  The capital city is Tanchico and the country symbol is the Throne of
Light.

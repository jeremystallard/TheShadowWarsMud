<PRE><H1>ASSASSINATE</H1>Syntax: assassinate <victim>

Assassinate is a skill used by murderers and assassins.  It is similar in
many ways to backstab, but gives the user a small chance to kill the victim
in a single blow.  That makes it a powerful and dangerous skill that is used
only by master thieves.  

You can only assassinate by using a dagger.  Any other weapon will just not
work.  

For PCs you need to hide/be in the room for 45 seconds before you can try
to assassinate a PC.  This to remove the abuse of flee/assassinate until a
mortal blow has been gained.  

This restriction is not set for MOBs.

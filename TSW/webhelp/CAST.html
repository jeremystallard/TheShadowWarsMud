<PRE><H1>CAST HEAL WEAVE</H1>Level: 50

Syntax: cast heal <character>

This healing weave uses all five flows: </FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Air</FONT>, </FONT><FONT COLOR="goldenrod">Earth{, </FONT><FONT COLOR="blue">Water</FONT>, </FONT><FONT COLOR="red">Fire</FONT>, and </FONT><FONT COLOR="yellow">Spirit</FONT>
to fully restore all health points to a character.  A common side effect
with any sort of healing is exhaustion and hunger.  The patient should rest
after a healing and should have plenty to eat.  

As with any healing weave, the channeler cannot cast this upon his or
herself.

<PRE><H1>'SHIELD BLOCK'</H1>Shield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with a
shield.  Characters with no shield block skill will not be able to defend
themselves well with a shield.  All classes may learn shield block, but only
warriors are good at it.  Beware, flails ignore shield blocking attempts,
and whips have an easier time getting around them.  Axes may split shields
in two.

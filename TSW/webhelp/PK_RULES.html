<PRE><H1>PK_RULES</H1></FONT><FONT COLOR="red">-</FONT> A PK fight will only be valid if the players are within 7 levels range of
each other.  For example a level 14 PK will only get a valid kill if he
attacks and kills someone in the level range 7-21. 
 
</FONT><FONT COLOR="red">- </FONT>If a PK is grouped with a non-PK and wins a fight they won't get a valid
kill out of the fight.
 
</FONT><FONT COLOR="red">- </FONT>Attacking a non-PK will not count as a valid PK kill and will not generate
a corpse to be looted. 
 
</FONT><FONT COLOR="red">- </FONT>In a valid PK fight the winner has the right to loot the other player's
corpse at the end of the fight.  
 
</FONT><FONT COLOR="red">- </FONT>In a PK fight the player that lost the fight will lose an amount of
experience based on their level, that amount of experience will be
automatically given to the one who killed the player.  If the player in
question doesn't have any experience they will have to get extra experience
to reach next level.
 
</FONT><FONT COLOR="red">-</FONT> Engaging in a PK fight while a player is RPing is not acceptable and not
allowed be the person a PK or not. 
 
</FONT><FONT COLOR="red">-</FONT> PK, Quest Equipment and Tokens can't be looted. 
 
</FONT><FONT COLOR="red">-</FONT> Non-PK are not allowed to loot a PK's corpse.  If you are not a PK and you
find a PK's corpse on the ground leave it be.  Getting any items from such
corpses will result on the non-PK being forced to become a PK by the
Immortals. 

</FONT><FONT COLOR="red">-</FONT> PK people can give looted items to non-PK people but they must give it
instead of the non-PK person taking it from the corpse.  Taking anything
from a corpse that is not yours will be considered looting.
 
</FONT><FONT COLOR="red">-</FONT> Once a player is PKed they will be given a timer of 30 minutes in which
they can look for their corpse or gather equipment without being attacked by
another PK.  The timer will reset if the player quits and then logs on again
before the 30 minutes are up.
 
</FONT><FONT COLOR="red">-</FONT> If any players are found to be abusing the PK system to get their ranks
higher and get the monthly prizes they will have their PK rank reset or set
to negative up to the Immortal that catches them.
 
Remember that the rules are set in place so everyone can have a good
experience and have fun.

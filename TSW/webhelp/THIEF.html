<PRE><H1>THIEF</H1>Thieves are a marginal class.  They do few things better than any other
class, but have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are
specialists at thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas
undetected where more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are
better fighters than channelers, but lack the wide weapon selection of
warriors.

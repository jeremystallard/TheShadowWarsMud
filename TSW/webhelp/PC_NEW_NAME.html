<PRE><H1>PC_NEW_NAME</H1>Welcome as a new player to The Shadow Wars.  

If you are starting a character, be aware that some names are reserved or
even not allowed.  We try to encourage selecting a name that falls into the
realms of the Wheel of Time.  

Please understand if you pick a name from the books that before validation
you may be asked to choose a new name.  

New characters will be validated to play as soon as one of the Admin have
approved your name and appearance.

<PRE><H1>CHANGE CHANGER</H1>The syntax for using the changer is as follows:

give <amount> <gold/silver> changer

For example, "give 200 silver changer."  

The value of silver to gold is 100 to 1.  Therefore, you need 100 silver
coins to have the changer work - giving you back one gold coin.  

However, the changer also charges a small fee.  You in fact need 105 silver
coins to receive one gold coin in return.

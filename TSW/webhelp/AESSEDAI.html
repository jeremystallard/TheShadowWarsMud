<PRE><H1>AESSEDAI 'AES SEDAI'</H1>Aes Sedai are the primary known wielders of the One Power.  Since the
Breaking of the World, all known Aes Sedai are women.  Aes Sedai live longer
than non channelers, and are known to develop an ageless face.  Those who
are the age of many grandmothers are said to have only one or two white
hairs in their heads and no lines or visible wrinkles.  They are bound by
the Three Oaths they swear upon being raised to Aes Sedai, but other than
that are only limited by their strength and ability in the One Power.  The
Ajah they are a part of is marked by the color of the fringe on the shawls
they wear.

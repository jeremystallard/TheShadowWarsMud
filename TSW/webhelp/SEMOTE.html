Syntax: semote <emote string>
 
The SEMOTE allows you to set a "emote as name" that you can use
in your emote strings, so that you don't have to type
the name each time using an emote.
 
You must set an "emote as name" before you can use the semote.
 
To set an "emote as name" use the following example:
semote as Bob
 
To use the semote, see the following example:
semote $n looks around, but feels like he is the only one here.

Will look like: Bob loos around, but feels like he is the only one here.

<PRE><H1>TEACH</H1>Syntax: teach <player> [amount] <skill/weave>

The '</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">teach</FONT>' command allows you to share your knowledge in a skill or weave
with other players.  To be able to teach another player, he or she needs to
be in your group.  

Teaching yourself is, by code definition, a means of practicing something by
yourself until you need help from others, or have it at a level that is
sufficient for you.  

Teaching others or teaching yourself costs both experience points and trains
for the one receiving the knowledge.  

If you are going to teach skills or weaves it must be done icly.  

You must rp that they are learning a skill/weave and you should not be
training more than 1 point per session.  Sessions should be of a good length
to cover neccesary practice time.  I would suggest 20 minuets real time
atleast.  

Now if you are going to teach someone the mastery forms.  BladeMaster,
Duelling, or SpearDancer.  You are not a master of your weapon until you
have been given the mastery weapon.  Most people do not want to be taught
from an amature as they will get incomplete or wrong teachings.  

Now that doesn't mean you cant practice together and the 1 person could then
increase the other abuility, but you can not claim a pupil as your teacher. 


There are players that are masters in each catagory of mastery weapons.  So
if you really are looking for a teacher they are out there to find, and
there is the mobs that you can still teach you if you dont want to rp the
act.

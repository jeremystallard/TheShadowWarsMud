The Wheel weaves as the wheel wills, the air continues to be cold, the heat
of the day bearly able to help anything grown.  Spring had never fully came,
and neither would the summer.  Wars and rumors of wars were spreding. 
Shadowspawn seen as far south as Ebou Dar, making there attacks small as
though searching for something.  The rumors of Men that could channel had
changed to fact as countries tried to find those that would protect them. 
Will the pattern hold back the death and destruction of the Dark One.  The
Wheel Weaves as the Wheel Wills.

<PRE><H1>BALEFIRE</H1>During the War of Power, the One Power was used in ways previously
unimagined.  It was used as a fearsome weapon, and as a tool to make
conventional weapons more dangerous.  

But no use of the One Power was as frightening as the weave known as
balefire.  Both sides of the war discovered this dangerous weave, and used
it liberally.  It was invincible.  The searing liquid fire destroyed
anything it touched.  

But then both sides discovered the hidden cost associated with balefire.  It
actually burned threads of the Pattern out of existence before they were
destroyed with balefire.  The stronger the weave of balefire, the further
back the thread was destroyed.  

Once this was discovered, both sides discontinued the use of balefire. 
During the year balefire was used, entire cities were destroyed with this
most dangerous weapon.  Had the use of balefire continued, it is quite
possible the entire Pattern would have unraveled.  The very existence of the
Pattern would have been endangered by widespread use of balefire.  

While its use is forbidden even to this day, there are some who still
possess the knowledge to weave balefire.  It can only be hoped that these
individuals never again choose to use balefire.  For when one begins its
use, others will follow.  And the Pattern might again be endangered.

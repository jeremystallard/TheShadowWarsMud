</FONT>" --From a Saldaean poem

Saldaea is the largest Border nation.  It stretches from the cliffs of the
Aryth Ocean, known as the World's End, to the River Arinelle and the
northern edge of the Black Hills and it covers more area than Shienar and
Arafel combined.  Saldaea is usually ruled by a Queen.  Her sigil is three
silver fish, one above the other, the Silver Fish and her banner is the
Silver Fish on a field of blue.  The capital city is Maradon.  

The people are known for their distinctively tilted almond-shaped eyes and
their military prowess.  The Saldaeans' ferocity in battle is equal to that
of the other Border nations, though their equestrian skills are far
superior.  They are the finest light cavalry in the known world.  

The Saldaean cavalry can perform mounted drills and maneuvers in units as
large as 9000 without a single horse or rider missing the mark.  They seem
more at home on a horse than on ground and can routienly perform stunts
normally only done by gleeman, but all on the backs of galloping horses. 
They can stand in the saddle on feet or hands, ride two horses at once with
one foot on the back of each, full speed dismounts and remounts and even
crawl completely under and around the charging animal.  

The Marshal-General is responsible for defending Saldaea and commanding the
military.  War for Saldaeans is a family event, though the women do not
participate in the fighting, the wives of most officers and all nobles
traditionally accompany their husbands on all campaigns except for those
into the Blight.  Girls are not taught the sword, but many are quite skilled
with knives or in hand to hand combat.  There are stories of Saldaean women
picking up their fallen husbands' swords and leading the men back into
battle.  

The usual mode of dress for Saldaean women reflects their strength of will,
consisting of high necked dress with long sleeves.  Highborn women often
wear elaborate embroidery down the sleeves and on the collar, and the dress
is often silk or brocade.  Farmgirls wear the same basic style, but in wool.
These farmgirls are just as fierce as their betters, known for shaving the
head of any woman caught poaching another's chosen male.  Men and women of
all classes usually travel armed with at least a knife though in Saldaea
steel is never drawn unless the wearer intends on using it.  

Saldaea's economy is strong, with brisk fur trade from trappers, fine woods
from forests, and ice peppers from farms.  These goods are usually shipped
to Mayene or Tear where they command a good price from nobility.  

Despite their otherwise formidable virtue, Saldaean women can be extremely
sensual.  Ladies of the court are known for the subtlety of their
seductions, using the language of fans to communicate their thoughts to
potential suitors.  The infamous ' sa'sara ' is a dance outlawed by a number
of Saldaean Queens for its indecency, and yet almost all noblewomen know how
to dance it, though only a few admit it publicly.  The sa'sara, when danced
by one who knows the moves, apparently has the ability to make men's blood
boil.  Saldaean history records three wars, two rebellions, and 47 unions
and feuds between noble houses, as well as innumberable duels, sparked by
women dancing the sa'sara.  There is even a tale of a defeated queen who
quelled the rebellion by dancing it for the victorious general.  He is said
to have married her and restored her throne, though the story has been
denied by every Queen of Saldaea.

<PRE><H1>petshop</H1>In order to create a pet shop, you must first have two adjacent room
vnums.  For example's sake, let's use 100 and 101.  First, you need to go to
room 100 and edit it like you would any other.  For the room type, you
should set it as a pet shop by typing "room petshop".  Once the room is set,
the code is in for the room to sell pets.  Now, all you need is a mob reset
in this room.  This mob doesn't need to be a shopkeeper, just a mob in room
100 for the code to work from...  A pet keeper, if you will.  

Next, go to room 101.  This room will serve as a kennel and should not have
any exits.  You don't want players walking into this room and finding your
pets for two reasons.  One, because your pets should be rideable mobs (this
is done by setting the action, or "act rideable."  ) If a player were to
walk into your kennel, they would get a free ride.  Also, if they kill all
the pets in the room, other players will have to wait for a repop in order
to actually buy a pet.  

Anyway, in this room 101, you will want to reset all of the mobs that you
wish to use as pets.  When this is done, type "purge" and "edit room reset".
Looking at room 101, you should see one of each animal you wish to sell. 
Then, go back to room 100 and type "list".  A list of all the animals you
reset in room 101 should appear as buyable pets.  

Just a few notes about pet shops.  1.)  You can not adjust the price of a
pet.  The price is automatically set with the level of the pet.  The higher
the level, the more expensive the pet.  However, the longer it lives, so it
is worth it.  2.)  Pets are nice to have, they are also expensive.  Let's
not have a trillion pet shops for players to buy rides at...  The average
player wouldn't be able to afford a 50, 000 silver piece horse.  Only nobles
and merchants would be riding animals like that.  SO, I would like to set
the number of pet shops at one per area.  
 
That's all :) Keep building and have fun!

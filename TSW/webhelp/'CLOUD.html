<PRE><H1>'CLOUD DANCING' CLOUD DANCING 'WEAVING OF WIND'</H1>A person with this Talent can affect and shift the local weather.  A
person with this Talent may find it easy to make it rain, sleet, snow,
hailstorm, thunderstorm, dust storm, tornado, blizzard, or even hurricane. 
However, the channeler is limited by if if the weather is appropriate for
the season, and they have no control over how the weather acts once they
have directed it in the desired way.  The effects of altering the weather
tend to keep going along whichever lines the channeling formed them into. 
This Talent is cultivated by the Sea Folk Windfinders who refer to it as the
Weaving of Winds.

<PRE><H1>HIDE SNEAK</H1>Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.
Hide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the
character remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to
sneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Only warriors and
thieves may learn these skills.

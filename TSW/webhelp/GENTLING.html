<PRE><H1>GENTLING GENTLE</H1>The act, performed by Aes Sedai, of shutting off a male who can channel
from the One Power.  This is necessary because any man who learns to channel
will go insane from the taint on saidin and will almost certainly do
horrible things with the Power in his madness.  A man who has been gentled
can still sense the True Source, but he cannot touch it.  Whatever madness
has come before gentling is arrested by the act of gentling, but not cured
by it, and if it is done soon enough death can be averted.  A man who is
gentled, however, inevitably gives up wanting to live; those who do not
succeed in committing suicide usually die anyway within a year or two.  One
believed permanent, gentling is now known by some to be susceptible to a
highly specialized form of Healing.

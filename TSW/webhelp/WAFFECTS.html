<PRE><H1>WAFFECTS WARDS SENSING_WARDS</H1>Syntax: waffects <direction>
 
The waffects command allows a channeler to try sense for wards set on
a room or an area. Sensing wards that is beyond you is difficult. Sensing wards
that is made with little usage of the One Power, or inverted, will be almost impossible
to detect, even for a skilled eye.

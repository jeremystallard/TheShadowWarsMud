PK goes for Player Killing where characters can test their skills by
attacking each other and fighting until one of them is subdued.  Typing gopk
will turn your character into a player killer which will allow you to attack
other players and be attacked as well.  Think carefully before you type in
gopk since the command is irreversible, once pk it can't be undone.  

You can check out who is a PK by typing 'who' without the quotes.  Players
Killers will be flagged on the wholist with a (PK) tag before their name. 
To check your kills and deaths as a PK you should type pkrank.  

To attack another player the command is 'murder' without quotes.  Simply
type murder followed by the name of the player you with to attack.  

Every month a list containing your rank among other Player Killers will be
generated and a prize will be awarded to the first, second and third places
in that list.  Your rank will be determined by the difference between your
number of kills and the number of times you have been killed.  Keep in mind
that abusing the system by getting your buddies to die for you or dying for
your buddies to get the PK rank prize will be severily punished by the
Immortals.  

Once a PK is subdued by another PK in a valid fight a corpse will be
generated and winner has the right to loot the corpse.  The person that lost
the fight will be transported to a recovery room and they will have a timer
of 30 minutes in which they can't be attacked by other PK.  

Trollocs are automatically set PK after creation but humans get to choose
whether or not they wish to follow the path of Player Killing.  

Keep all that in mind if you wish to become a PK and don't forget to check

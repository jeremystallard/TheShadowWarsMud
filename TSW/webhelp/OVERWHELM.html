        overwhelm
 
Mounted warriors can be a feared sight and opponent. Over the time,
a counter attack known as 'overwhelm' has developed to try to
dismount a mounted fighter.
 
The overwhelm skill is such a brute force move that for
classes outside the warrior and thief class will not be
able to utilize this move.
 
Using the 'overwhelm' with a target, will start a fight.
 
Using 'overwhelm' during a fight will try to overwhelm
the victim that you are already fighting.
 
History also show that a failed attempt to overwhelm
a mounted victim can be devestating to a fight.

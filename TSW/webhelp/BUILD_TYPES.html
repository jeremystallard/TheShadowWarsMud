When you select certain types, more code will come up, asking you to supply
more information about the obj you are creating.  The following is a guide
to help you with this information.  

Type</FONT><FONT COLOR="white"> light</FONT>: v2 = light hours.  A light that never goes out should be set
with a value of -1.  

Type</FONT><FONT COLOR="white"> scroll</FONT>: v0 = level; v1, v2, v3, v4 = spells (Each one can be set with a
different spell.  Up to four different spells can go off with one scroll.) 


Type</FONT><FONT COLOR="white"> wand</FONT>: v0 = level; v1 = charges total; v2 = charges left; v3 = spell
Type </FONT>staff</FONT>: v0 = level; v1 = charges total; v2 = charges left; v3 = spell

Type </FONT><FONT COLOR="white">weapon</FONT>: v0 = weapon class ("?  Wclass" for available weapons); v1 =

For standard armor, you have a number of points equal to the level of the

has a value of 20 to distribute.  So, pierce 5, bash 5, slash 5, exotic 5. 
Or, pierce 10, bash 5, slash 5, exotic 0.  Or, pierce 0, bash 10, slash 10,
exotic 0.  Etc.)

plan to have it lock); v3 = capacity (number of objs/people allowed in the
container); v4 = weight mult.  Type drinkcontainer: v0 = liquid total
(100000 if you never want it to run out.  Use this number sparingly); v1 =
liquid left; v2 = liquid (type "?  Liquid" for different types); v3 =
poisoned (your options are yes or no).  

Type</FONT><FONT COLOR="white"> food</FONT>: v0 = food hours (how many ticks the food will last before player
sees hunger); v1 = full hours (how many ticks the player will be full for.

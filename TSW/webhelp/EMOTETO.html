<PRE><H1>EMOTETO</H1>Syntax: emoteto <victim> <string>

Emoteto is extremely targetted on The Shadow Wars.  As such, it's somewhat
complicated.  However, the parsing is pretty straight forward once you get
the hang of it.  

In your emote string, you will need to place different $ commands in place
of "you" "your" etc.  

For Example: If I were to emote something to an Aes Sedai, I would type
emoteto sedai smiles at $N and bows to $M

which would cause others to see <YOU> smiles at an Aes Sedai and bows to her
while it would cause the target to see <You> smiles at you and bows to you. 


Syntax and grammer is up to you to figure out.  
 
use test <target> to see which $ commands to substitute for which results,
but a quick guide is:
$N = Name
$M = Him/Her
$E = He/She
$S = His/Her (possessive)
 
Capital letters refer to your victim, lowercase letters refer to yourself.

<PRE><H1>TROLLOCWARFARE 'TROLLOC WARFARE'</H1>Syntax: Automatic

Over the years the trollocs have devised their own means of fighting.  Where
humans rely on skill the trollocs rely on brute savage tactics These can
range from a headbut to literally fighting with teeth and nails.  The
trollorwarfare skill is a measure of just how savage the trolloc can become.
The skill is automatic and requires no input from the player.

<PRE><H1>STEAL</H1>Theft is the defining skill of the thief, and is only available to that
class.  It allows items to be stolen from the inventory of monsters and
characters, and even from shops!  But beware, shop keepers gaurd their
merchandise carefully, and attempting to steal from a character earns you a
THIEF flag if you are caught (making you free game for killing).  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="red">Steal is meant to be used ICly exclusively.  In other words, when both
parties have their IC flag up.  Do not abuse this by never going IC or
dropping your IC flag when in the presence of people you oocly know are
thieves.  </FONT>

<PRE><H1>WARRIOR</H1>Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters
of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical
talents of channelers.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind
taking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.

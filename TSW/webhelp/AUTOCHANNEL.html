<PRE><H1>AUTOCHANNEL</H1>Syntax: Autochannel <0-100%>
 
The 'Autochannel' command let a channeler set the amount of OP to seize or
embrace in percentage of their max OP.
 
The auto channeling amount will only be used when the seize/embrace command, or
the channeling command is used without an argument. The auto channeling amount will also
be used if you are not holding OP and try to combine flows into a weave.

The auto channeling amount set will be used each time you type seize/embrace/channel
without an argument. E.g. Setting it to 10% will each time seize/embrace
10% of your max OP.

Setting the Autochannel amount to 100% and type seize/embrace/channel twice will
result in you trying to channel 2 x your max OP!

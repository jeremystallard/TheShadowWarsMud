<PRE><H1>BLADEMASTER</H1>The blademaster skill represents the culmination of all a character's
training in that they no longer simply uses a sword, but in that now their
sword is a part of them, an extension of their will.  A Blademaster will
utilize various attack routines also called "forms".  Each form has it's own
properties and uses.  Some forms are used to create a spinning attack which
leaves an opponent off balance, while others comprise of vicious attacks
that penetrate an opponents defence.  Repeated usage of the Blademaster
skill will cause for these forms to be used more often in combat, as well as
a greater proficency with them.

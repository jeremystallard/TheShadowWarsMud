<PRE><H1>AJAH</H1>An Ajah is "a sisterhood of Aes Sedai".  In current times there are seven
known ajahs, each associated with a color.  There are Red, Yellow, Green,
Blue, Brown, Grey, and White Ajahs.  Each Ajah has their own set of three
Sitters in the Hall of the Tower to represent them.  As well, each Ajah has
their own ruler or ruling council, but the head of the Ajah is not
necessarily a Sitter for the Ajah.  The actual identity of these Ajah
leaders is often not shared amoung the Aes Sedai of different Ajahs.  There
is rumored to be an eighth Ajah, the Black Ajah, but no Aes Sedai seems
willing to speak of it.

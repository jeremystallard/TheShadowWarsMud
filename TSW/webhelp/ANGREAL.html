<PRE><H1>ANGREAL TER'ANGREAL TERANGREAL SA'ANGREAL SAANGREAL</H1>Aes Sedai often bemoan the fact that so much knowledge has been lost
since the Age of Legends.  What once was commonplace is now unheard of.  But
more than knowledge was lost during the Breaking of the World - many angreal
have been lost over time.  

Angreal increase the amount of the One Power that an Aes Sedai can channel. 
Some angreal are quite small, almost appearing to have been made as gifts,
while others give the user more substantial gains.  

Again illustrating the differences between saidar and saidin, the angreal
which work for men do nothing for women and vice versa.  A woman holding an
angreal attuned to a woman feels a sort of warmth from the angreal.  The
same woman holding a male angreal will feel nothing.  

Angreal are not to be confused with ter'angreal, which were created to use
the Power in a specific manner.  Several of the known ter'angreal are
doorways or arches which some how transport the person who enters to a place
or time which appears to be quite real.  The White Tower has such a
structure with three archs which is used to test Novices who hope to gain
Acceptance.  This ter'angreal is activated using the One Power, following a
set ceremony for the process.  The Novice is made to face her worst fears,
first for her past, second for her present, and third for her future.  In
the Waste, in Rhuidean, a similar ter'angreal is used to show the Wise Women
possible futures.  The White Tower also contains the closely guarded
ter'angreal which they call the Oath Rod.  

While rare, angreal and ter'angreal are not as rare as the even more
powerful sa'angreal, which are virtually unheard of.  Angreal are extremely
valuable, and the White Tower is extremely careful about who uses them and
where they are at all times.

Certain mobiles have the ability to restring your items, for a certain
amount of silver.  Since they are members of a very rare profession, these
mobiles may charge a great deal for their services.

Each object has three fields that can be restrung.  

The 'name' field in the keyword of the object.  
The 'short' field is the string you will see when using, ie: in your
inventory, or on your person.
The 'long' field is the string you will see when the object is on the
ground, or examined.

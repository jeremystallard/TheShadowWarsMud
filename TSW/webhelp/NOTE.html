These commands are used for the new note system. Instead of just one area,
there are several, each with its special purpose. 

Changing between the areas is accomplished using the 'note area' command.
By using the 'note scan' command gives you a list of all areas together with number of
unread message. To change, type 'note area <number>' or 'note area <name of the board>'.

To read next unread note, type NOTE. To read a note with a specified number,
type NOTE READ <number>. Typing NOTE while in a board with no unread notes
shifts you to the next board. Note that unlike the standard note system, a 
note has the same number in NOTE LIST and NOTE READ.

Posting a message is as simple as writing NOTE WRITE. You will be moved 
into interactive mode, where all you see are prompts for the fields like 
To:, From: etc. You will be automatically put AFK while writing a note.

To see the list of the notes in the current board, type NOTE LIST. Typing
NOTE LIST <number> will list only <number> of the last notes in the area.

You can remove your own note by using NOTE REMOVE <number>. Implementors may
remove other people's notes. Implementors can also select how many days
their note is kept before being purged. Purging happens automatically at
bootup. Purged notes are not deleted, but saved into a file.

To let only immortals see your note, address it to "imm". To let players of
a specific level and above, address it to that level (no other recipients may
appear in that case).

Make sure you type </FONT><FONT COLOR="white">NOTE POST</FONT> once you have finished typing the note in
to submit it to the note area.

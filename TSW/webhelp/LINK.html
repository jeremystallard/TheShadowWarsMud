<PRE><H1>LINK UNLINK</H1>Those that can weave the One Power can also Link together with others in
order to form a more powerful union, sharing the power, and accomplishing
more.  

Linking on TSW tries to follow the guidelines of the Robert Jordan books
concerning who can initiate a link, how many can be linked into the circle,
passing the link, and what the affects of linking are.  

In order to link, you must have learned the link skill.  

After that, you place yourself in or out of "ready to link" state by typing
link with no arguments.  

The person who is initiating the link will then join people with "link
<target>" 

In order to unlink, the person holding the link must release people from the
link either individually, or collectively with "unlink" "unlink all" or
"unlink <name>" 
 
Passing a link can be done with "passlink <name of linked person to pass to>"

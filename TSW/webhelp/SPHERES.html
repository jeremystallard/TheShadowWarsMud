and in certain ways, they are what combines to do the work of the channeler.

All channelers are stronger in some areas than others.  A channeler who is
very powerful in Air, even to the point of creating spectacular weaves that
can change the weather itself, may be so weak in Fire that a small spark to
ignite a campfire is difficult.  While the first four spheres are rather
obvious in the things they manipulate, Spirit could be considered the sphere
of the body.  While all healing requires all five spheres to some extent,
Spirit is used to delve and explore.  It is also thought to be the sphere
used in Bonding.

<PRE><H1>KANDOR KANDORI</H1>Kandor lies between the nations of Arafel and Saldaea, along the
Blightborder.  Though the martial arts are as highly developed here as in
any border nation, the Kandori have also developed a skill for trade and
alone of all the Border nations have established a highly respected guild
for merchants.  Though Chachin's nearness to the Blight prevents it from
being a center of commerce, the merchants have established a strong
reputation and have brought much wealth back with them.  Kandori men are
easily spotted by their distinctive forked beards, as well as on to three
silver chains worn over their coats.  Kandori also usually wear an earring,
and the earrings of some successful merchants guilds are quite ostentatious.
Members of nobility also wear chains over their coats and earrings.  

Kandor is ruled by Queen or King and the sigil is a rearing red horse, the
Red Horse.  The banner is the Red Horse on a field of pale green and the
capital city is Chachin.

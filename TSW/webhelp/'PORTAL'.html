Syntax: cast 'portal' <target>

Composed of threads of </FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Air</FONT>, </FONT><FONT COLOR="goldenrod">Earth</FONT>, and </FONT><FONT COLOR="yellow">Spirit</FONT>, the portal weave is similar
to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal to the target creature,
instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are entered using 'enter' or
'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot be made to certain
destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.  Portal requires a
special source of power to be used, unfortunately the secret of this
material component has been lost...

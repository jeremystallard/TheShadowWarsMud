<PRE><H1>RESET RESETS</H1>Syntax: RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> <location on body>    - equips last mobile
        RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> inside <obj vnum>     - store in container
        RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> room                  - store in room
        RESET <number> MOB <vnum> <maxarea> <maxroom>   - load a mobile
        RESET <number> DELETE                           - delete a reset
 
 
RESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number> will
be displayed with this list - meaning the order that the resets are in.  
Typing '? wear-loc' will list possible locations for an object to be reset.  
<maxarea> refers the maximum number of that vnum mob in your area.  Don't be
skimpy if you mean to have many of the same type of mob prowling in your
area.  <maxroom> refers to the maximum number of that vnum mob that can be
in the room, be it from being reset or from wandering into the room.
 
For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example, if you are equiping a mobile, make the mob reset 1 and then 
load all of the equipment as reset 2, 3, 4, etc. If you reset anything else 
between the mob and its equipment, the reset will not work and the mob will 
not be wearing anything. Or, if you are making a container, the container 
will need to be reset 1 and the object inside the container needs to be reset
2.

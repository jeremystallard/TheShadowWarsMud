<PRE><H1>TREE_SINGING 'TREE SINGING' TREE SINGING</H1>An ability of the Ogier race to sing to trees, making them grow straight
and tall.  It also imparts the ability to heal trees, and most importantly,
sing wood from them.  This process obtains objects made from the living wood
that are without seams or crafting marks, and does not harm the tree in
their making.  The geriatric effect among Ogier is similar to the effect
channeling has among humans.

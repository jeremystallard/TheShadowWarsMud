Syntax: guard self
 
For some a good guard can mean life or death. When the swords are drawn and the
heat is at it's worst, those skilled with beeing a guard can make sure those
in their party is staying safe against attackers, by putting them self
in between an attacking blow and the one that is guarded.
 
To guard someone, they need to be a member of the same group.
 
To start guarding someone, or guard a new person, use 'guard <person>'.
 
To stop guard someone, use 'guard self'

The block skill allows a warrior or thief to put him/her-self in
the path of an entrance, trying to prevent anyone from leaving or entering
the room he or she is standing in.
 
To stop block an exit you must use the 'block none' option.
 
To examine what exits that are blocked, you can use the 'blocked' command.
 
To attack the player who is blocking an exit, use the
'murder' command with the blocked direction.

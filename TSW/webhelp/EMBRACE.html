EMBRACE is the skill which measures your ability to embrace the One Power
and your ability to use it without fail.  You can embrace up to your full
potential in the One Power, or beyond, but the closer you get to the maximum
you can hold, the closer you come to risking burn out or worse.  

CAST is the command which will allow you to embrace and cast a weave all in
one command.  If done as a substitue for embracing, it will only embrace one
half of your potential One Power ability.  

UNCHANNEL or RELEASE will both allow you to let go of the One Power, there
by eliminating the risk of you burning out from holding the One Power too
long.

<PRE><H1>BACKSTAB</H1>Backstab is the favored attack of thieves, murderers, and other rogues. 
It can be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing
weapons.  The damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's
level, his weapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.

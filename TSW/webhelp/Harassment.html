<PRE><H1>Harassment</H1>Here on the ShadowWars we will not tolerate harassment of the players.  

We have put rules in place that will help this from not happening, but it is
each persons responsibility to know and understand the rules.  Just because
you dont read them, does not give you a free pass to not follow them.  

Some of the important help files to read are help pk, pkrules, pk_rules,
help gopk

Harassment is defined as someone that torments another person continuously. 
What falls under harassment will be left up to the admin to discuss with you
at the point that you think you are being harassed.  We want this place to
be as for as many people as possible.  

Harassment also does not come just in the form of being subdued.  Using
weaves to harass people is just as bad as subbing them.  

So if you think you are being harassed please come and talk to us.  We can
then help make things better.

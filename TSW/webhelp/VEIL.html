Syntax: veilapperance [<appearance>]

The code of dress among the Aiel has changed very little since the Age of
Legends and the Da'shain Aiel.  The shoufa, a scarflike garment, usually the
color of sand or rock, that is wrapped around the head and neck, leaving
only the face bare.  When preparing to kill, they pull the shoufa over the
noce and mount as well, veiling the face according to tradition.  

Before you can pull the shoufa over your face, you need to set a veil
apperance for your self.  The veil appearance needs to have the following
keywords in it: 

Keyword 1.) Veil or veiled.
Keyword 2.) Figure or Aiel.

Using the '</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">veilappearance</FONT>' command without an argument will simply display
the short string of your veil apperance.  

To veil and remove the veil, retype the commands again.  They will toggle
the option.

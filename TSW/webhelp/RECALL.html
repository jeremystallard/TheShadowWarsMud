<PRE><H1>RECALL /</H1>Syntax: RECALL [<CITY>]

RECALL prays to Creator for miraculous transportation from where you are
back to your recall room.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.  

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for
fleeing), and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for
fleeing).  This chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall
does not insure success.  

RECALL costs endurance points.  

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by
a curse may not recall at all.  

The cities that may be recalled to are: Caemlyn, Cairhien, Maradon, FalDara,
Tear, Shaido, Osenrein, Mayene, and Falme.

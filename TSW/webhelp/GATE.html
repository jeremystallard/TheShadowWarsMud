<PRE><H1>GATE</H1>Syntax: cast gate <from room-key> <to room-key>

The gate weave is a far simpler, far more direct, far quicker means of
transport.  The gate weave open a doorway from one physical point to another
by using flows of </FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Air</FONT>, </FONT><FONT COLOR="goldenrod">Earth</FONT>, and </FONT><FONT COLOR="yellow">Spirit</FONT>.  

Men do this by boring a hole in the Pattern, so to speak, while women do
this by making the Pattern in both locations identical (LoC, 37, When Battle
Begins, p491).  Moghedien and Rand are of the opinion that using the wrong
method would be catastrophically bad.  

Stepping through the gate, one instantly changes location.  

To gain enough knowledge from a place to be able to open a gateway to or
from it, require the use of the '</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">study</FONT>' command.  

After studying a room for 5 ticks, the secret room key will be revealed.  

See also '</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">help traveling</FONT>' for more information.  See also '</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">help seal</FONT>' for
how to seal a open gateway.

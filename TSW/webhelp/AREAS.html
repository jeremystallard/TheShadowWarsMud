AREAS shows you a list of areas in the game.

SCORE shows much more detailed statistics to you only. Your ability scores
are shown as true value(current value), so for example Str: 15(23) means
you have a 15 strength from training, but a 23 strength from other factors
(spells or items).

TIME shows the game time, as well as the time the mud was last started,
and the current local time for the host computer.

WEATHER shows the current game weather.

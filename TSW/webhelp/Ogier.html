The Ogier do not have a specific country to call their own, instead they
live in secluded stedding scattered throughout the world.  They are the only
natural nonhuman race known.  Ogier resemble humans in general build and
dress, but are a genetically seperate species with long tufted ears and
broad, vaugely snoutlike noses.  Much larger than humans, the men average
ten feet in height with the women standing only slightly shorter.  A typical
Ogier life span is at least three or four times longer than a human's and
they are not considered old enough to leave the stedding until they've at
least reached 100 years old.  Their longer life is probably the reason for
their deliberately slow and certain behavior.  They consider humans much too
hasty and impatient.  

Ogier stedding are shielded from the One Power somehow and completely
prevents the One Power from being channeled or even sensed inside.  Any
attempts to channel the One Power outside the stedding have no effects
inside it.  The air inside the stedding seems different than that of
outside, fresher or more peaceful, causing most people to shiver in suprise
upon entering.  No Trolloc will enter a stedding unless driven, and even a
Myrddraal will do so only at the greatest need and will still be reluctant. 
Even Darkfriends, if truly dedicated, also feel uncomfortable and unwelcome
there.  The exact properties of a stedding are unknown.  

During the Breaking, the land and sea shifted so dramatically that all of
the stedding were swallowed up, leaving the Ogier homeless and wandering. 
Among the Ogier, this was known as the Exile.  The wandered the land looking
for their sanctuaries and after several years they began to Long for it. 
They Longed for the stedding so badly that they began to sicken and die. 
More Ogier died than not.  Since that time, Ogier do not leave the stedding
for extensive amounts of time.  If an Ogier stays Outside too long, the
Longing takes him and he will weaken.  If he does not return, he dies.  The
Ogier are bound to the stedding.  

The Ogier are known as wondrous stonemasons and when given free reign, tend
to make their stonework amazingly organic with buildings almost appearing to
be alive somehow.  Many of the great human cities, like Tar Valon, can still
boast Ogier built buildings.  Though marvelous stoneworkers, the Ogier feel
that it is beneath their abilities.  They love working with living and
growing things and have created groves all over the land, though most have
been torn down.  There is one Ogier grove that is well tended in Tar Valon
on the grounds of the White Tower.  Their second love is knowledge.  They
love to read and write and value books and records highly.  

Their clothing are often heavily embroidered, with women wearing embroidered
flowers in a quantitiy to suit their station.  Girls wear flowered trim only
on their cloaks, while women Elders' dresses are embroidered from throat to
ankle.  Necklaces and bracelets all reminiscent of leaves and vines are also
worn, but earrings are not.  Ogier ears are a secondary erogenous zone, and
are therefor kept partially covered by hair.  To bare them enough for
earrings would be to shocking.  All women wear their hair loose and long and
men wear theirs shorter than women.  Men's coats are various lengths, and
their shirts and trousers are plain.  Every aspect of clothing and jewelry
for both men and women reflects the profound Ogier respect for nature and
all living things.  

The Council is the only full time government within a stedding is aided by
other Ogier on particular projects when their skills are needed.  They use a
system of apprenticeship to train younger Ogier in responsibility and work
skills.  The apprentices only do menial tasks because that builds character.



The Ogier are almost a matriarchal society with the head of the Council
Elders a woman, and mothers and wives have more authority than their
husbands.  Marraiges are arranged by mothers, with the consent of the
bride-to-be, but the groom-to-be has no say-so.  A lot of young Ogier go to
work a bachelor and returned home to discover that he will be a groom the
next day.  

Ogier are typically peaceful by nature, though, it has been rumored that
they are indeed fierce fighters if provoked.

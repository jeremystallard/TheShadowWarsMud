<PRE><H1>finish</H1>Syntax: finish <person>

Use "finish" when you have subdued someone icly and wish to finish them off
(read kill them/put them out of their misery/put them out of your
misery/etc) 

Both you and the victim MUST be in Complete IC mode (toggled by the RP
command) Your victim MUST have been subdued completely.  Knocking them over
the head just won't cut it, you have to take them down.  

WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING

To be perfectly clear on this.  Abusing this in any form will get you
deleted.  

Abuses include killing people in places you would have no IC way of getting
to.  If you think you can get there, even though it's difficult, clear it
with the Admin first.  

It also includes going into RP mode to attempt to make a kill, fleeing when
you realize you're going to get plastered, and dropping out of RP mode to
escape the consequences.  

For the victim, it includes dropping out of RP mode in the middle of a fight
(or in the middle of fleeing) to make sure you aren't killed.  Once an IC
fight has been started, it is expected to be completed IC.

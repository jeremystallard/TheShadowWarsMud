<PRE><H1>DUELLING</H1>For some skilled thiefs, wielding and using their daggers has become a
art much like the fine skilled warriors and their blademasters.  

A master of the daggers will utilize various attack and defensive routines
also called "forms".  Each form has it's own properties and uses.  

The duelling skill is a long lost art that only a very few posess.  Finding
these few is a task of seeking out the darker places and speak to the right
voices.  

There is rumors of a man, or a woman, that travels through the land teaching
a very few the skill of duelling.  A master thief indeed.

<PRE><H1>MERIT MERITS FLAW FLAWS TALENT TALENTS</H1>During character creation you will have the option to select merits,
flaws and talents that will be unique for your character.  

A merit is something that add to your character abilities, while a flaw
takes away from your abilities.  

Talents are special abilities that can give access to a wide range of new
skills or weaves that those not so talented can't access.  

See help files for each of the merit, flaw and talent by using the command
'help <merit/flaw/talent>'

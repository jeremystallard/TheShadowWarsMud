<PRE><H1>CALM</H1>Syntax: cast 'calm' 

This simple weaving of </FONT><FONT COLOR="yellow">Spirit</FONT> is one of the most useful and often overlooked
abilities of the channeler, as it can put an end to all violence in a room. 
Calmed creatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a
disadvantage in combat as long as the weave soothes their minds.  The more
violence activity there is in a room, the harder the weave, and it is all or
nothing -- either all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of
those who are immune to channeling) or none is.

<PRE><H1>STILLING</H1>The act, performed by Aes Sedai, of shutting off a woman who can channel
from the One Power.  A woman who has been stilled can sense the True Source,
but she cannot touch it.  So seldom has it been done that novices are
required to learn the names and crimes of all who have suffered it.

die unless they find something to replace the emptiness left by the One
Power.  While it has always been believed that stilling was permanent,

limits to this which are yet to be explored.

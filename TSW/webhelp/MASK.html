Syntax: mask
 
Only if you are within the valid definition of a masquerade can one
use both the 'maskapperance' and the 'mask' commands.
 
The 'maskappearance' command allows you to define an appearance that
other will see when you mask.
 
The 'mask' command makes you put on or take of a mask for a masquerade.
 
All that take part in a masquerade and have put their mask on gets a
(</FONT><FONT COLOR="darkmagenta">Masked</FONT>) flag in front of their apperance.
 
Once you leave the defined area or definition of a masquerade, the
mask will be taken off.

<PRE><H1>BUTCHER</H1>The butcher skill can only be used if a mobile has been killed and is
useful in creating food so that you do not have to go to a shop to buy it. 

Once a mobile has been killed and there is a corpse in the room, type
"butcher corpse" and the skill will take effect, creating steaks that will
be left on the ground. Be sure to pick them up if you wish to eat them.

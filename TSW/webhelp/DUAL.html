<PRE><H1>DUAL WIELD</H1>SYNTAX : dual <weapon>

By means of the dual wield skill the character in question gains the ability
to use a second weapon in their off hand during combat.  The second weapon
must be lighter (have less weight) than the primary.  The higher the skill
level the more accurate the character is with their off hand.

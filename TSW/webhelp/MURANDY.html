<PRE><H1>MURANDY MURANDIAN</H1>Murandy lies north of Altara and south of Andor.  Similar to Altara, the
people of Murandy do not respect their nations as much as they respect their
local nobility.  The King officially rules Murandy, but the actual power is
divided between the all but independant lords and ladies who rule their own
little patches of land.  The king seldom has little control over events in
the capital city of Lugard, much less in the rest of the country.  Most
believe that the only reason the Murandians even have a ruler at all is as a
deterrent against annexation by neighboring nations, for their lack of
national cohesion does not stop Murandians from being extremely suspicious
of outsiders.  Most see every foreign action as part of a plot.  Andorans
are particularly hated, mostly because of a long history of fights along
their common border, though, close to the border the two people are almost
indistinguishable except by their dress.  

The sigil of Murandy is a red bull, the Red Bull, and her banner is the Red
Bull on a field of vertically striped blue and white, three blue and two
white.  The banner is fringed in red when flown where the sovereign is
present.

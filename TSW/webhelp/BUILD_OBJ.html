<PRE><H1>BUILD_OBJ</H1>In order to create a obj, you begin by typing:

"oedit create <vnum>" - vnum refers to a vnum you have been assigned that is
not currently being used for another object.  

After you have typed this command, hit "enter" and your obj's information
will show on the screen.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Name:</FONT> Type in the names you wish your obj to be known by.  (i.e. yummy piece
chocolate) 

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Area:</FONT> This section automatically lists your area number and name.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Vnum:</FONT> This number should be the number you typed in to create the obj.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Type:</FONT> Type "?  Type" for available options.  Also, see "help build_types"

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Level:</FONT> Assign your obj any level 1-100.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Wear flags</FONT>: Type "?  Wear" for available options.  Be sure to set any object
that you want taken with a wear flag of "take."  If you do not, players will
not be able to take food, armor, weapons, etc.  They will simply lie on the
ground, unuseable.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Extra flags:</FONT> Type "?  Extra" for available options.  Please use sparingly
and not at all for average items.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Material:</FONT> Type in whatever the item is made of.  If it's food, use organic,
if it's a rock, use stone, etc.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Condition:</FONT> Is the obj brand new, in 100% tip top shape?  Use 100. 
Otherwise, set value accordingly.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Weight:</FONT> How much does your object weight?  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Cost:</FONT> See "help cost" for some standard values.  Otherwise, just be
reasonable.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Short descr:</FONT> A short description of your obj.  (i.e. a yummy piece of
chocolate) The short desc should have no capital letters unless it is a
proper noun and it should have no punctuation unless it is an apostrophe.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Long descr:</FONT> A long description of your obj.  (i.e. A yummy piece of
chocolate melts in the middle of the road.)  This is what your players will
see when they enter the room.  The long desc should begin with a capital and
end with a period.  In other words, it should read like a sentence.  

To finish, type "done" and you will leave the obj editor.  Remember to save
your area by typing "asave area"

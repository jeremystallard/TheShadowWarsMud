<PRE><H1>BUILD_ROOM</H1>In order to begin building, you should have received an area name and a
set of vnums to use.  Each of these vnums can be used to build a room, a mob
and an obj.  For example, let's use vnum 123.  There is a room with vnum
123, a mob with vnum 123, and a obj with vnum 123.  

To start your area, you'll need to create a room.  Use the first vnum you
have been given and type the following command: "redit create vnum" (i.e.
"redit create 123") 

By typing the command, the code will put you in room 123 and open the room
editor for you.  If you hit the "enter" key, you will see the room editor. 
If you chose to finish now, type "done" and the editor will close.  To
reopen it, simply type "edit room" and you are set to build your room again.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Name:</FONT> What do you wish your room to be called?  (i.e. An Open Field) Always
use capital letters when naming a room.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Area</FONT>: This section should list your area number and name already.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Vnum:</FONT> This number is the vnum of the room you are editing.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Sector</FONT>: Type "?  Sector" for available options.  Be sure to set your sector
as it effects the weather a player sees in a room and also the amount of
endurance used to traverse the area.  (i.e. A sector set as inside prevents
a player from seeing rain.)  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Room flags:</FONT> Type "?  Room" for available options.  (Hint: set room indoors
AND sector inside so that weather does not show in a building.)  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Heal rec:</FONT> How many hit points will a player receive while in this room
during ticks?  We usually keep this value at 100 (the default) 

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">End rec:</FONT> How many endurance points will a player receive while in this room
during ticks?  We usually keep this value at 100 (the default) 

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Characters:</FONT> The code will list what players and mobs are currently in the
room.  Leave this blank.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Objects:</FONT> The code will list what objects are currently in the room.  Leave
this blank.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Description:</FONT> How does your room look?  This is what players will see when
they first enter the room.  

Now, once you have built your first room, you will want to build more.  But
how?  Instead of using the "redit create" command for every room you wish to
create, you can link rooms to an existing room and the code will
automatically create them.  Here's how: 

Once you have built room 123, you can build 4 rooms off of it.  One to the
north, south, east or west.  The command is "east dig 124" or "north dig
124" etc.  By typing "done" and looking at your room, you should now see an
exit in the direction you created your link.  By moving in that direction,
you are now able to "edit room" and begin building that room in the editor. 

After you have linked your rooms together using the link command, when you
hit enter, you will see something like this "-West to [12544] Key: [ 0] Exit
flags: [door]" listed after the "WObjects</FONT> section.  This is information
about the west exit in that room.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">-Direction to [vnum]</FONT>: Tells you which directions you can travel from the
room you are standing in and to which vnums they go to.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Key:</FONT> This is the vnum of the key that will open a locked door leading to the
specified direction.  You will need to create an key type object and then
use the syntax "key <vnum>" 

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Exit flags:</FONT> It defaults to [door] but there are also commands that allow you
to modify this door.  It can be hidden or closed or locked, etc.  To see
available options, type "exit."  

When you are done with the room editor, type "done" and always remember to
"asave area" so that your work isn't lost in an accidental crash.  

As always, this help is meant to be a learning tool.  Please don't hesitate
to ask questions!  
 
And, most importantly, have fun!

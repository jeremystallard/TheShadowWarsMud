<PRE><H1>PURGE</H1>Syntax: purge
	purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name.

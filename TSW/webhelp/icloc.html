<PRE><H1>icloc iclocrecall </H1>Syntax: iclocrecall <set>

This command sets a recall point for your IC Location.  It is to be used as
a way for you to get to the location you are roleplaying in quickly, and for
NO other purpose.  

Setting your iclocrecall location near the quest master is against the
rules.  Setting your iclocrecall any location that you are not currently
roleplaying in order to get past hard to get around mobs or hard to get
through mazes is abuse.  

Don't abuse it, or it will be removed from anything you, or any of your
characters can use.

<PRE><H1>WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER ARROW AXE DAGGER FLAIL LANCE MACE POLEARM SPEAR SWORD WHIP STAFF EXOTIC</H1>Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how
well a character fights with a particular weapon.  The weaponsmaster group
provides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.
If the character has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.
The chance of parrying is best if the character in question is skilled at 
both his weapon and his opponent's.

The weapon skills consist of the following:

weaponsmaster	skill group of all weapons listed below (save exotic weaponry)

staff               the skill which allows you to wield a staff

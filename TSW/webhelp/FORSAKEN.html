<PRE><H1>FORSAKEN SEMIRHAGE</H1>Semirhage

Have you ever tortured an entire city, made thousands of people assist in
breaking each other slowly, in breaking their own loved ones?  Semirhage did
that, for no more reason than that she could, to prove she could, for the
pleasure for it.  

Taller than most men and well proportioned with long slender fingers.  She
is graceful and calm with dark eyes and a dark face.  She enjoys the simple
pleasure of needle work.  Because Lanfear wears white, Semirhage wears
black.  

Nemene Damendar Boann was the best Restorer ever, being called from anywhere
at an instant to Heal the impossible.  However once she had Healed her
patients, she like to extract some pain from them.  Most were too happy to
be alive to worry about a bit of torture, although if she thought they
didn't deserve to live, she would kill them.  When the Hall of Servants
found out, she was given the choice of being bound from sadism, or severing.
She chose Shayol Ghul instead and was one of the first to become Chose.  

She hates Aes Sedai totally, and exacted revenge on members of the Hall of
Servants, by breaking them and having them proclaim publicly for the Dark
One.  She Governed many times with cruelty and violence that stands out
among the chosen.  She discovered how to turn a channeller to the shadow
with a circle of thirteen channellers with thirteen Myrddraal.  

Semirhage takes enormous pleasure in cruelty and anguish.  She once tortured
an entire city with everyone breaking each other slowly until they all died.
Loved ones and friends breaking the spirit of each other, just to show she
could.  She also once made a man scream every waking moment for five years,
and kept him sane.  His heart finally failed.  A prisoner being told they
were being handed to Semirhage would commit suicide.  She considers death an
escape.

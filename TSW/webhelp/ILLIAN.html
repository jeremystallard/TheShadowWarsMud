</FONT>" ---Fateful words of the first king of Illian 

Illian is a powerful nation on the Sea of Storms bordering the weaker
nations of Altara and Murandy.  Wealthy from sea-, land-, and river-borne
trade, Illian protected the weaker Altara during the Whitecloak Wars to
insure that the nation would remain a buffer between Illian and Amadicia. 
In Illian, the King is not the sole political leader of the nation.  He is
"advised" by a council of lords, known as the Council of Nine.  Historically
these nine lords usually end up contending with the ruler for power.  The
King's power is further weakened by the presence of a second "advisory"
body, known as the Assemblage.  Chosen by and from Illian's merchants and
ship owners, they too end up contending for power more often than giving
useful advice to either the Council of Nine or the King.  The result is that
no one person or group actually controls Illian's destiny.  There is always
a three way battle over any task or legislation.  

Most men of Illian wear long coats with raised collars and beards that leave
their upper lip bare.  Many lords also wear boots fringed with gold or
silver.  

Women, both high and low, favor wide-brimmed hats held in place by long
scarves that are wound around the neck in a utilitarian and decorative
fashion.  High ladies adorn themselves with decorative slippers heavily
worked with gold and silver.  Their dresses are cut high at the hem to show
the slippers to best advantage.  The dresses also usually have low-cut
necklines to show the lady's natural assets to best advantage as well.  

The sigil of Illian is nine golden bees arranged in a diamond, from top to
bottom 1-2-3-2-1...  The Golden Bees, and the banner is Nine Golden Bees on
a field of green.  The banner is fringed in gold if flown where the
sovereign is present.  The capital city of Illian is of the same name and
it's symbol is the Laurel Crown.

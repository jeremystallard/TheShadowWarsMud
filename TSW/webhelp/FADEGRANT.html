<PRE><H1>FADEGRANT</H1>Those trollocs who prove themselves as valuable and experienced assets to
this game will have the chance of being given the grant to become a
Myrddraal/fade.  The Trolloc will be one whom gets along with the general
public and can solve his problems alone.  Once a trolloc is granted to fade,
they can still be put back as a trolloc if they misbehave.  All Myrddraal
are to act as examples for the trollocs and will be given special skills and
advantages which are to be kept secret from the public.

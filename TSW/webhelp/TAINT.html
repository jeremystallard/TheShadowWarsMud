<PRE><H1>TAINT SAIDIN</H1>Saidin, the Male half of the True Source, was tainted when the Dark One
was sealed in the bore.  The Dark One's counterstroke is what caused this
taint.  Men who wield the One Power are destined to go mad, and are said to
die while their body literally rots around them.  It is not known at this
time if it is possible to cleanse Saidin.

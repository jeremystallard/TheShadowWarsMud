<PRE><H1>faceless</H1>A faceless character is a temporary character created for RP purposes.  

Upon creation, you will be asked if you wish to be a faceless character and
if the answer is 'yes', a template of the class chosen will be created. 
When the faceless character quits the game, the character is automatically
deleted.  

With a faceless character, you are not allowed to PK, teach, gain or train
skills/weaves.  

Please keep in mind that this is a RP tool and should be used with care. 
Any abuse will be dealt with harshly.

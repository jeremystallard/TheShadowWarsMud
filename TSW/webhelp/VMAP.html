<PRE><H1>VMAP</H1>The World map (or virtual map / vmap) is a graphical representation of
Randland as found in Robert Jordan's "Wheel of Time" books.  When you are on
the vmap, you see a character based representation of the land around you. 
To get a description of the symbols representing the World map, please see
the [ </FONT><FONT COLOR="white">help legend</FONT> ] section.
 
To enter the vmap, you need to find a room in the different sectors that has
a valid exit point. These are marked with a Leave(Area) in the exit prompt.
By typing '</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">leave</FONT>' in a room that has this exit,  you will leave the area
and enter the World map.
 
Some locations on the vmap have links to areas. You will, in most cases,
find these marked with symbols like '</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">C</FONT>', but sometimes you will have to
examine the terrain more closely. Perhaps you will find a secret area or a
hidden treasure...
 
When you stand on a vmap location that is linked to an area, you will see
it marked as 'enter(nesw)' in the exit prompt. The characters inside the
() represent the direction which you can enter the area. By typing '</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">enter n</FONT>',
for example, you will enter the area from the north end.
 
See [ </FONT><FONT COLOR="white">help legend</FONT> ] for help on symbolic vmap usage.
See [</FONT><FONT COLOR="white"> help map</FONT>    ] for help on the grafical layout of the world.

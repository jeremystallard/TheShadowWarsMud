<PRE><H1>newbiehelper</H1>Welcome to the ShadowWars.
 
To become a </FONT><FONT COLOR="yellow">Newbie</FONT> </FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Helper</FONT> please read the requirements first.
1. You must be over level 30
2. You must have played with us activily for atleast 6 months.
3. Be familiar with mobs and eq that are below 30, so you can help the newer players.
4. Understand the rules of the game.
 
If you can do all of those please send a note to admin in the immortal area for concideration to be a newbiehelper.
 
 
Once you are a </FONT><FONT COLOR="yellow">Newbie</FONT> </FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Helper</FONT> there are a few things to follow.
1. Do not validate names that are book names, or names that do not fit into the WoT world.
2. Never validate your own alts.
3. Never validate a player unless they have an approprate appearance.
 
Using the command </FONT><FONT COLOR="white">review (player)</FONT> will help you to see what you need before you validate them.

Using the command </FONT><FONT COLOR="white">setapp <player> <appearance></FONT> will let you
change an unvalidated players appearance for them.
 
For names, the restrictions of book names that do not fit in
a wheel of time world are names like mat, Lan, Rand, Elayne, Batman,
Skywalker, Vader, Scooby, and others of this sort.
 
Names that are acceptable are any found in the Wheel of Time name
generator at www.wotmud.org/names
and most other names found in Real Life situations, although RJ has a 
habit of not using the exact spelling on them.
 
Robert Jordan has pulled in Asian names, European names, and more variations 
than most can keep track of.  If it's reasonable 
and you can find it with a google search and it's not a major character in a
popular series/movie, accept it.

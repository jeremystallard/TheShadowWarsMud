<PRE><H1>Ared</H1></FONT><FONT COLOR="darkred">A</FONT><FONT COLOR="red">r</FONT>e</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">d</FONT> is known for his laid back, lazy nature.  If he seems to be ignoring
you, it's probably because he is asleep at his keyboard or AFK to get some
food.  He likes to think that he is a meany, but he's not.  He's really as
gentle as a teddy bear.  He's one of the nicest, most helpful imms you will
meet AND one of the laziest;)

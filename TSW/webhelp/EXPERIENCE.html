<PRE><H1>EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP EXP</H1>Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set 
amount of experience points for each level based on your creation points.

You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.

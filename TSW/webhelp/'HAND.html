<PRE><H1>'HAND TO HAND'</H1>Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of the Wheel of Time. 
Learning this style of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed
-- bare hands.  Trained hand to hand experts are far more effective than
many swordsmen.  Warriors are the best at this skill, although thieves and
channelers may also learn it.

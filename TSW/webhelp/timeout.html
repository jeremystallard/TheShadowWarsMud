<PRE><H1>timeout punishment</H1>Syntax: timeout <player> [<# of days>]

This command will place the character on "timeout" for the given number of
days.  Until the time is up, the character will not be allowed to log in to
the game.  The default is two days, so specifying "timeout <character>" will
put them in timeout for 2 days.  

The check is made at login time and a message is displayed to the person
attempting to log in that they are in timeout and are given a date and time
when they will be able to log in again.

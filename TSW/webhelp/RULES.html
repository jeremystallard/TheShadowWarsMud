<PRE><H1>RULES</H1>These are the rules of TSW.  For other matters, use common sense.  

* Limited player stealing or player killing.  

* Your presence here is a privilege not a right.  Obey any orders from gods,
and you will be fine.  Deletion does not require a reason, appeals are to be
sent to the implementors.  

* Sitting around idle with a client is hazardous to your health.  We don't
recommend it, but keeping your characer online by using triggers is not
against the rules.  

* Botting (Ex: using a client to level your characters) while you are away
from the keys is not acceptable.  A few triggers to assist with levelling
will be tolerated, but if you are found to be letting a bot run, you may
lose your character, levels, or any number of things.  

* Multiple logins are allowed with restrictions.  Read help multiplaying for
details.  

* No kill stealing.  This means you cannot attack a mob someone else is
fighting, unless they ask you to.  Also avoid attacking fleeing mobs.  

* Cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods
and exploiting bugs.  If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.  

* Harrasment of any form will not be tolerated.  This includes sending
people tells after they've asked you to stop, as well as repeatedly
complaining about someone to the Administration when they are leaving you
alone.  

* Discussing who plays what characters on the game over public channels is
strictly prohibited unless the player in question has given you explicit
permission to do so.  Many people like a little bit of privacy, the admin
staff often prefer to not have to worry about people treating their
characters differently because they also admin the game.  The first offense
you may get off with as light as a warning, (or perhaps a warning balefire),
the second time, you lose all of your equipment (even the quest equipment),
the third time, more drastic measures will be taken.  (Public channels
consist of all channels that you can toggle on or off, including minion)

* Changes to these rules are at the discretion of the immortals, and may be
done without warning, notice, or even evidence of sanity.  Walk softly, and
carry a big stick.

If you are fortunate enough to have discovered a Talent for the lost art of
Aligning Matrixes, you will find weaves of </FONT><FONT COLOR="goldenrod">Earth</FONT> and </FONT><FONT COLOR="red">Fire</FONT> will form into an
enchant armor weave which imbues armor with powerful protective properties. 
It is not nearly as reliable as enchant weapon, being far more prone to
desctructive effects.  Each succesful enchant increases the plus of the
armor by 1 or two points, and raises its level by one.

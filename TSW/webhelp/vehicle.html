<PRE><H1>vehicle</H1>There are special items known as vehicles here on the ShadowWars.  They
are obtainable when you reach either the Merchant or Noble status, and are
approved for the role.  

To enter a vehicle: enter (vehicle name)

To leave a vehicle: leave

((While in the vehicle))

Drive the vehicle: drive (direction)

Look out of vehicle: look out (vehicle name)

-When you look out of a vehicle, it will only show you the open exits.  You
will not see hidden, or closed exits from inside the vehicle.  

Vehicles can not recall, or be summoned.  They can also not travel through
gates.  So you must remember wher eyou leave them and drive there from one
spot to another.

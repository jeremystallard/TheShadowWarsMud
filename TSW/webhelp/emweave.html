Things to remember: Do not roleplay what you can not backup in code.  If you
don't have the gag weave, don't use emweave to emote it.  If you don't have
balefire, don't emote it.  Do NOT use emweave to communicate with other
channellers in the room to get around a non-channeller hearing/seeing
something.  

In other words, use common sense.  If it is used appropriately, it will stay
as it is.  If it is abused, it will be removed.

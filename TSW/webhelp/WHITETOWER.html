<PRE><H1>WHITETOWER 'WHITE TOWER'</H1>The White Tower is the central structure on the island city of Tar Valon.
Designed by Aes Sedai, it was created by Ogier aided by Aes Sedai wielding
the One Power.  The main building is three hundred feet across at its base,
and rises five hundred feet above the ground.  The structure is composed of
white stone, slightly wider at the base than the top.  

Aes Sedai are housed in the top portion of the White Tower.  Each Ajah has
their own pie shaped section of the Aes Sedai levels.  The bottom half of
the Tower is reserved for general purposes.  A smaller structure is attached
to the back of the main building and houses Novices and Accepted.  The front
of the White Tower faces a large public square, which is bordered by various
public buildings which were both ogier built and designed.  The entire White
Tower complex is enclosed by a stone wall.  This perimeter is broken
occasionally by columns and rails.  

The largest building on the Tower complex is located behind the Novice and
Accepted Quarters.  This is the Great Library which contains offices,
workrooms, and one of the largest collections of knowledge in the world.

<PRE><H1>acceptdeath</H1>Syntax: acceptdeath <new name> [keep]

Acceptdeath is used after someone has killed your character.  

Before you use it, post any remaining notes that you need to post from the
waiting room.  Say your ooc farewells, keep it clean....  

And then use the command.  

In order to keep your current stats and spheres (for those of you that have
put tons of time and quest tokens into them) type "acceptdeath <newname>
keep".  If you do not type the "keep" on the end, you will be rerolled with
new stats and spheres.  

This command will allow you to pick a new name and go through creation
again.  You will be reset to level 1.  You will, however, be granted enough
experience to level back up to 3/4 of your previous level.  

Ignore the mistakes in the totals when setting merits, flaws, and talents
for the moment.  They will be corrected shortly.

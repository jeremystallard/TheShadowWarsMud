Most of the islands in the Aryth Ocean and the Sea of Storms are home port
to the Atha'an Miere, most commonly known as Sea Folk.  Only a few of these
island groups are known to outsiders, and fewer still have been seen by
them, since the Atha'an Miere do not usually allow visitors or traders,
though they are certainly not as cruel to intruders as the people of Shara
or Seanchan.  The Sea Folk perform most sea trade, and nearly all of the
trade in silk and ivory from Shara, yet few people know them save through
stories and legend.  

To understand the Atha'an Miere, you must look at their ships and the waters
they sail because People of the Sea live out most of their lives aboard
their ships.  They are born on the water- even if their mother must row out
from shore in a borrowed boat to bear her child- and they die on the water
if at all possible.  Any time spent away from the sea is time spent awaiting
another ship, another voyage.  To the Atha'an Miere, each ship is a living
spirit, gifted with a man's heart and a man's courage.  These ships are just
as much a part of the Sea Folk family as any human.  The new crew themselves
oversee the construction of their ship, doing most of the skilled labor
themselves.  The ship is usually owned by the clan of the Sailmistress who
captains him, if not by the Sailmistress herself, though occasionally a ship
belongs to a clan different from those who sail him.  The ships fall into
four general classes.  From smallest to largest, they are the darter,
soarer, skimmer, and raker.  Anything smaller than a darter is considered a
boat, not a ship.  The fastest class of ship is the raker.  These ships are
far superior than any other ocean vessels in speed and manageability and are
the key to the Atha'an Miere's unquestioned dominance of the sea trade.  

The Sailmistress is the commander of the ship and crew.  She controls where
and when the ship travels as well as who may board him.  She is aided by the
Windfinder, who is second officer and chief navigator.  Some Windfinders can
channel, and that is kept secret by the Atha'an Miere.  Defense and trade is
managed by the Cargomaster.  He is usually married to the Sailmistress and
has final word in all the trade negotiations and matters of defense.  He
cannot tell the Sailmistress where to sail and she cannot tell him what
goods to trade for.  

The Atha'an Miere are exotic in appearance, wearing brightly colored tattoos
on their hands, sometimes denoting clan, and equally brilliant sashes on
their waists, gold and silver jewelry and a distinct style of dress.  

Throughout the known world, tales relate the almost irresistable allure of
the Sea Folk women, the epitome of beauty and temptation.  The deep
chocolate coloration of their skin and their unequaled grace, born of years
balancing on wind-lashed rigging on the high seas, contribute to their
allure; the Sea Folk custom of wearing nothing above the waist except
jewelry once beyond sight of land has enhanced the legends.  The well
muscled men, clean-shaven are bare-chested, are also considered dangerously
handsome.  

Men and women both wear baggy breeches held at the waist by brightly colored
sashes, multiple earrings, neck chains and bracelets, and bare feet, though
the quality of the breeches and scarf fabrics is directly related to status
and financial state of the wearer.  The women also wear brightly colored,
loose fitting blouses, though only while in port- probably in attempt to
avoid shocking the locals.  The women also wear a ring in the left side of
their nose.  Women of rank wear a fine chain, hung with medallions,
connecting the nose ring with one of their earrings.  The quantity of
medallions is directly related to rank.  The more medallions, the higher the
rank.  The men do not wear nose chains or nose rings.

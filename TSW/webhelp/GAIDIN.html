<PRE><H1>GAIDIN WARDER</H1>Aes Sedai have a weave which is learned upon becoming Aes Sedai which is
quite unique.  This weave, a composition of mainly Spirit, binds the Aes
Sedai to a man of her choice permanently.  In doing this, the man is given
the ability to heal quickly, to go without rest, food, or water for long
periods of time and the unique ability to sense the taint of the Dark One,
even froma distance.  As well, both Aes Sedai and her Warder, as they are
called, are given the ability to sense one another's state of health.  If
either dies, the other will sense it.  However, there is a difference, for
if the Aes Sedai should be the one to die, the Warder will lose his will to
live and seek death often times.  Very rarely are they able to be kept
alive.  

Warders are also know as Gaidin, a term which means Brother to Battles. 
They go into the bonding almost always voluntarily, though some have been
done against the Warder's will.  The loyalites of the Gaidin are completely
to their Aes Sedai, and they live where their Aes Sedai lives.  For example,
when on the grounds, the Gaidin remain in a special area, their own private
quarters closely set to the Tower.  

Gaidin's numbers are not dictated by Tower Law, however by tradition, a man
is not bonded to Red Aes Sedai ever.  Most other Ajahs, should they have a
Gaidin, remain with only one.  There is an exception, in that the members of
the Green Ajah tend to bond as many as they wish.  

While the closeness of the bond may seem to lend to a certain ammount of
intimacy, the relations are chaste a majority of the time.  Aes Sedai have
many pressures and demands upon them, and Warders tend to fall into the role
of guardian and protector most often.  As with anything, there is
exceptions, and Aes Sedai on very rare occasions have been known to marry
their Warder, however this has usually only happened amoung members of the
Green Ajah.

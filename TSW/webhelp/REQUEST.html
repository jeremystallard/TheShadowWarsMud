<PRE><H1>REQUEST</H1>Syntax: request
Syntax: request <guild>
 
The 'request' command will generate a note that is sent
to the 'guild' as a request to join.
 
This command can be used when none from the guild you seek
is available or online to speak to you about joining.
 
The guild will contact you as soon as they are able once
a request has been sent.
 
Using the 'request' command with no argument in a room
where a guild have a guild guard will send a message
to all players that is online in that guild that you
request assistance.

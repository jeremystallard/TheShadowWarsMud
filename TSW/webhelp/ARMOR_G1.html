<PRE><H1>ARMOR_G1</H1>These are guidelines for armor.  None of them are set in stone, but if
you chose to stray from them, please have a reason to do so.  

Armor should be set at the same level as the mob that is wearing it.  

Don't set a piece of armor with everything from the "extra" flag.  Each
piece should be unique and should do something different.  Weapons with
several "extras" should be quest weapons.  

When creating a piece of armor, you have a number of points equal to the
level of the armor.  These points should be distributed thoughout the armor
class values for the weapon: pierce (v0), bash (v1), slash (v2) and exotic
(v3).  For example: 

A level 20 piece of equipment has 20 points to distribute.  Here are some of
the combinations.  

pierce 20 bash 0 slash 0 exotic 0
pierce 5 bash 5 slash 5 exotic 5
pierce 10 bash 0 slash 0 exotic 10

Finally, earrings and rings.  No matter what level they are, they should
have ac levels of 0.  In other words, pierce, bash, slash and exotic should
all be 0.  Or, they should be set as type "treasure" instead of "armor." 
The protection of these items in a battle would be nil and therefore, to
keep it real, please abide by this rule.

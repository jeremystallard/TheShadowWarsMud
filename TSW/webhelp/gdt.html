These tools are the main means of IC and OOC Communication with the
currently online members of a guild or group.  Some muds have two channels
per guild, one for IC communication one for OOC communication.  We have a
single channel and hope that the players are capable of distinguishing the
difference.

Some people prefer prefacing all IC communication with a flag which states
something similar to </FONT><FONT COLOR="green">--</FONT><FONT COLOR="yellow">IC</FONT><FONT COLOR="green">--</FONT> so there isn't any confusion that what they said
was to be taken as In Character.  Others prefer something like </FONT><FONT COLOR="yellow">--</FONT><FONT COLOR="green">OOC</FONT><FONT COLOR="yellow">--</FONT> for
all OOC communication, then do not flag their IC communications.  

In the player run guilds, the guild leader (meaning the single person in the
guildlevel 1 spot) can set the policy for the guild.  In the IMM run guilds
(where an IMM or no single person holds the glevel 1 spot) the rules are
that each person can use whatever method he or she prefers.  

If there is a set policy in a guild which you are participating in, the
guild leader should post that policy to the guild in the permanent note
section, and should use the leaderpost option so that a future guildleader
may change it as needed.  While that person is the guildleader, the
guildmembers should follow the posted guidelines.  

Once again, to clarify, here on The Shadow Wars, the guild channels are both
IC and OOC, not specifically just one or the other.  Use it, don't abuse it.
The guildleaders DO have the right to use gmute and ogmute when there is a
problem on the guildchannels but should use common sense in using it.

<PRE><H1>BUILDER_COSTS</H1>These are suggestions and should be altered depending on the area, the 
object and the builder. It is alright to alter them :)

Remember that necessities should be less expensive than luxuries.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">CLOTHING</FONT> (should be commensurate with type of clothing)
newbie clothes .....................................   0
cotton clothes .....................................  45
woolen clothes .....................................  60
leather clothes ....................................  85
leather armor  ..................................... 150
chainmail armor .................................... 250
plate armor ........................................ 300

Weapons should cost between 150 and 300 depending on material and 
craftsmanship.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">FOOD</FONT> (should be commensurate with food hours)

a loaf of bread, a pie, a piece of fruit, candy ... 10-15 silver
                                and should last ... 2-4 hours
hunk of meat or cheese, a meal, rations ........... 15-25 silver
                                and should last ... 4-6 hours

tea, lemonade, normal drinks ......................  5-10 silver
alcohol ........................................... 15-30 silver
barrels of drink ..................................   250 silver

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">LIGHTS AND LANTERNS</FONT> (should be commensurate with light time)
a torch ...........................................  40 silver
                                and should last ...  2 hours
a lantern ......................................... 100 silver
                                and should last ...  5 hours

A light that never goes out should be set with a v2 of -1. These 
types of lights should be expensive or found on higher level mobs.
 
</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">WATER/CANTEENS</FONT> 
(should be commensurate with how much the container/fountain holds)

a small canteen ................................... 60-70 silver
                           and should hold (v0) ... 5-6 drinks
a large canteen ................................... 120-140 silver
                           and should hold (v0) ... 10-12 drinks

A fountain or never-ending canteen (which should only be a quest 
item) should have the v0 and v1 values of 100000. This way, they 
never run out.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">MOBS</FONT>

The amount of silver carried by a mob should be determined by the 
type of mob. Animals, trollocs and fades should not have a wealth 
value. Other mobs can be separated into other categories: poor, 
working-class, middle-class and wealthy. As an estimation, areas 
should be 30% poor, 30% working-class, 25% middle-class and 15% 
wealthy.
 
Examples:
A street urchin or a begger is poor.
A farmer, sailor, drunk or soldier is working-class.
A shop keep might be middle-class.
A mayor or noble would be wealthy.

MOB               CARRIED ON PERSON             IF KILLED AT HOME
Poor              0-5 silver                    0-15 silver
Working-Class     0-15 silver                   0-30 silver
Middle-Class      0-25 silver                   0-45 silver
Wealthy           0-50 silver                   0-150 silver
Royalty           < 200 silver                  < 200 silver
Shopkeeper        < 5000 silver

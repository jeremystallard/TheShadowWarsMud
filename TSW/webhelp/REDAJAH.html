<PRE><H1>REDAJAH 'RED AJAH'</H1>The primary goal of the Aes Sedai of this Ajah is to protect the lands
from all men who wield the One Power.  Men who can channel are hunted down
by these Aes Sedai and brought to the Tower to be gentled.  Because of their
purpose, or perhaps their distrust of men, they do not bond Warders.  This
Ajah is the largest and is led by a single woman.

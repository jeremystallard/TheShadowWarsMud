<PRE><H1>help.area Archery archer bow arrow</H1>To be an archer one must possess both the bow and arrow skills.  With
those skills, an archer may use the bow and arrows to shoot at their targets
from a distance, wounding them without being hit themselves.  In some cases,
if the archer is lucky, it will be a one shot one kill, but in most
instances the archer will have to shoot off several arrows to kill his or
her opponent.  The use of the bow and arrow are simple: 

You wield the bow as you would a sword or a dagger, and you hold the arrow.

equipment space.  Archery requires both hands.  

Then: shoot <direction> <victim>

So if I wanted to shoot Zandor and he was in the room to my west I'd type:
shoot west zandor

It's that easy.  Archers are excellent for long range attacks and can do a
decent amount of damage, but they are not without their weaknesses.  You
cannot shoot someone or anything if they or it is in the same room with you,
though if you're wielding the bow, you can beat them with it.  Also, if you
fire 20 arrows, then when you'll have to retrieve 20 arrows, as they are
arrows and not boomerangs and will not come back to you automatically.  Some
people use macros and/or aliases to shoot and collect their arrows and that
seems to help.

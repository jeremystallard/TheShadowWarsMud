<PRE><H1>GOLD SILVER MONEY</H1>The Wheel of Time's economy is based on gold and silver coinage (and the
lowly copper, which you as an adventurer are far too proud to carry).  Gold
coins are worth 100 silver coins, but are also four times as heavy (25 to
the pound, as opposed to 100 to the pound for silver).  Gems can be bought
to alleviate weight problems from the jeweller, he charges a mere 10% more
than they are worth.  10 gems weigh one pound, and they can be worth more
than 100 gold pieces for the highest quality stones.

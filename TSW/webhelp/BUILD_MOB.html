<PRE><H1>BUILD_MOB</H1>In order to create a mob, you begin by typing:

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">"medit create <vnum>"</FONT> - vnum refers to a vnum you have been assigned that is
not currently being used for another mobile.  

After you have typed this command, hit "enter" and your mob's information
will show on the screen.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Name:</FONT> type in the names you wish your mobile to be known by.  (i.e. tall man

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Hitroll</FONT>: This number should be 10 less than the level of your mob.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">Sphere:</FONT> This number should only be set for mobs that can channel.  Set it by
typing in 5 consecutive numbers for air, earth, fire, spirit and water,
respectively.  These values can be any number you wish, within reason. 
(i.e. 5 10 8 8 15)

{WForm:{x Type "?  Form" for available options.  

{WParts:{x If you have set a race, you will notice that this information
defaults to a part list for you.  Otherwise, you will need to type your part

and not at all on average mobs.

should have no punctuation unless it is an apostrophe.  

{WLong descr:{x A long description of your mob.  (i.e. A tall, green man strolls
casually down the street.)  This is what your players will see when they
enter the room.  The long desc should begin with a capital and end with a
period.  In other words, it should read like a sentence.  

{WDescription:{x What does your mob look like when someone looks at it?  

To finish, type "done" and you will leave the mob editor.  Remember to save
your area by typing "asave area"

PLEASE NOTE: These are guidelines for building mobiles on TSW.  Hit dice,
damage dice, endurance dice, sphere, armor class, etc.  Can vary from the
TSW standard as long as it is within reason.  We don't want invincible level
50 monsters running around out there.  Just use common sense and make each
mobile unique to its race, class, etc.  And, as always, if you have a
question, don't hesitate to ask.  This help is designed as a teaching tool
to get you started.  

Happy building!

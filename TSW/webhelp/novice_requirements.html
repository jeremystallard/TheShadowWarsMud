1.)  Etiquette: This requirement is met when you join the Tower and speak
with the Mistress of Novices, or her designated Assistant, who will explain
the rules and expectations that will be required from you during your time
as an Initiate.  This is also when you will sign your name into the Novice
Book.  

2.)  The One Power: This is a class that will instruct you on the basics of
the One Power, a little of it's history, the five flows, and the dangers of
channeling this Power.  NOTE: You must have this requirement met before you
can proceed to Embracing and Simple Weaves.  

3.)  Embracing: This class will guide the Novice through their first
official embracing.  Meditations are used by either Accepteds or Aes Sedai
to accomplish this.  If you decide that your character has a block, or will
otherwise not be able to embrace Saidar right away, then this requirement
must be repeated until either the block is broken, or you decide that it is
the right time for your character to channel.  

4.)  Simple Weaves: Using each of the five flows, Earth, Fire, Air, Water,
and Spirit, the Novice will learn a simple, one-flow weave in this class. 
This is also a good opportunity to roleplay your character's strengths and
weaknesses in the One Power, allowing you to further develop your character.


5.)  The Seven Ajahs: This is a new addition to the Novice Requirements. 
During this class, the Novice will learn about the Seven Ajahs that comprise
the Aes Sedai, the characteristics of each one, and what each Ajah's purpose
is.  After this class, the Novice should have a good idea of what Ajah she
will want to consider joining.  

5A) THe Seven Ajahs comes with an assignment.  You are required to meet with
4 Sedai from different ajah and get their opinions of their Ajah, how it
works, and what they focus on.  These 4 meetings can not count for the
miscellaneous rps that you need, they are a part of the class.  

((((((((((OTHER REQUIREMENTS))))))))))

* Novices must complete one(1) chore, either in RP, or in a story.  If the
chore is done through RP, at least two people involved, including the
Novice, must write a note to the Mistress of Novices and her Assistant.  If
done in a story, the story must be posted to all Initiates, the Mistress,
and her Assistant.  

* Before they are raised to Accepted, Novices must complete three(3) RP
sessions that are not classes.  The purpose for this requirement is to help
you develop your character more fully, during your time as an Initiate. 
These RPs can be pranks, other chores, conversations, or anything else that
would be appropriate.  (If you have a question on what would be appropriate
for this requirement, ask the Mistress of Novices.)  This requirement is met
when the Novice, and the others involved with the RP have posted notes
describing briefly what the RP was about, and what happened, to the Mistress
of Novices and her Assistant.  

((((((((((MISCELLANEOUS))))))))))

* IMPORTANT!!  Only one(1) requirement can be met per day, which is
twenty-four(24) hours, beginning from 12:00 AM system time.  This is to
ensure that you spend time as an Initiate, not only meeting your
requirements, but developing your character to the fullest.  Exceptions to
this rule must be approved by the Mistress of Novices.  

* Please keep the following in mind!  Once you have completed your
requirements, that does not mean that you are automatically eligible for
raising.  You have done what is required of you by the rules, but that does
not necessarily mean that your character has developed enough to face their
fears and become Accepted.  If there is a problem, the Mistress of Novices
will speak with you, and help you with whatever problems there might be.

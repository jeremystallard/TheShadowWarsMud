Most major cities have what is known as moneylenders or bankers.  These
provide a service to safe store your coins and ease the burden to travel
with the weight.  

The 'account' command will have the moneylender check your current financial
status and tell you how many gold and silver coins you have.  

The 'deposit' command will have the moneylender take the amount of gold or
silver you wish to safe store in the bank.  

The 'withdraw' command will have the moneylender check your current
financial status and if you have the amount asked for, give you either the
gold or silver coins as requested.

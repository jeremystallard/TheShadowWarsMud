Shadow Wars.  This appearance will be shown to other characters you have not
introduced yourself to.

The appearance needs to be reviewed by the Admin before validation is
granted.

Please use an appearance that fits into the Wheel of Time world.  Abuse will
be punished harshly!

Examples of possible appearances:
A tall slender man
A short young man
A tall red-headed Aiel woman

Appearance rules:
o Your appearance must be less than 35 characters long.

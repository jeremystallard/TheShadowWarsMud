Syntax: cast 'heat metal' <victim>

Heat metal is a powerful attack weave which uses </FONT><FONT COLOR="red">Fire</FONT>, with the effects that
vary according to the armor the victim wears.  It heats up the metal
equipment (assumed to be all weapons and armor at this time) on the target,
causing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the
process (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).

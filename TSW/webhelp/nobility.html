<PRE><H1>nobility merchant</H1>If you are wishing to play a character with nobility or wealth, you must
have the money to support your background.  

For High Court Nobility, with direct line to any of the thrones in the WoT
world, the head of the house (which must be a player) has to hav 90, 000
gold in the bank and then send their background to guildadmin.  You will
then be approved and notified of that approval.  

For minor nobility, with no right to any of the Thrones, needs to have the
head of the house (Again, this must be a player) have 60, 000 gold in the
bank and then send in their background to guildadmin to go through the
approval proccess.  

For merchant status, the player must have 30, 000 gold in the bank and then
submit their background for approval.  

Each person who is head of house, or head merchant needs to maintain the
gold amount in their back to keep their status.  If the amount of money
drops below the required levels then they will have to accept the IC
consequences to that character.  

When you meet the requirements for your rank and status you will be given a
free room/or vehicle here in the game.  Please keep them ic rooms to go with
your ic titles.  You will have to come up with your own room descriptions. 

To see the players that are nobles or merchants look at "help noble_list or
merchant_list"

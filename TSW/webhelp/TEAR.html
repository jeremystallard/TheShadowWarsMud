<PRE><H1>TEAR TAIREN</H1>The nation of Tear lies just east of Illian and contains the greatest
port on the Sea of Storms.  This port is located well above the mouth of the
River Erinin, and is guarded by the ancient fortress known as the Stone of
Tear.  Unlike other major ports, however, Tear's is not easily accessible to
the ocean.  It is protected by the winding maze of waterways within the vast
delta at the mouth of the Erinin known as the Fingers of the Cragon.  These
waterways are under complete control of the Tairens, who will not allow
ships to pass in or out through them without a Tairen pilot aboard.  Perhaps
unskilled sailors would be lost without a pilot, but for most voyagers, such
as the Sea Folk, the precaution is laughable.  

Unlike most other nations, Tear has no one ruler, no king or queen.  A
council known as the High Lords of Tear rule together and as a body.  The
members of this council must all be of particular rank, but there is no
fixed number of lords on the council, the membership has varied from as many
as twenty to as few as six.  All decisions are presented to the people as
unanimous.  The Lords of the Land- all the lesser Tairen Lords- then
participate in carrying out the edicts of the High Lords.  

The High Lords rule from the Stone of Tear, a massive fortress that
dominates the city of Tear like a small mountain.  The Stone is believed to
be the oldest stronghold of mankind.  It was built sometime during or
shortly after the Breaking of the World, and was made using the One Power. 
The One Power was used to draw stone from every corner of the world and fuse
it together into a single massive structure without seam or joint or mortar.
The Stone has been attacked and besieged over a hundred times and has never
fallen.  The Stone also holds the great sa'angreal sword called Callandor. 
The High Lords perform the Rite of Guarding four times a year, claiming to
be guarding the world from the Dragon Reborn, who would be the only man to
take the Stone and claim Callandor.  The Lords of the Land are also raised
to High Lords here and no one enters the Stone without permission.  Besides
Callandor, the Stone also contains a large cache of angreal and ter'angreal
that rivals that of the White Tower.  It is not certain whether the Tairen's
collected these artifacts to preserve them or hide them as all channeling is
outlawed in Tear.  

Tairen lords wear colorful coats of padded silks and brocades with puffy
sleeves, sometimes colored in stripes.  Their breeches are tight to show a
well-muscled leg to best advantage, and are often brightly colored.  Regular
soldiers are uniformed with brilliant red coats with wide sleeves ending in
narrow white cuffs.  A gleaming breastplate is worn over the coat so as to
let the sleeves show clearly.  Their breeches are often of the same tight
cut as that of the lords, though not quite so brightly colored, and are worn
tucked into knee- high boots.  Defenders of the Stone wear black and gold
coats with puffy sleeves as well as plumes of various colors on their rimmed
round helmets to mark officers and under officers.  The soldiers of a
particular lord wear that lord's colors on their puffy sleeves.  Common men
wear baggy breeches, usually tied at the ankle and held up by a broad
colored sash.  Some few wear coats, but unlike the lord's, theirs are long
and dark, fitting tightly to the wearer's arms and chest, then becoming
wider below the waist.  Sometimes low shoes or boots are worn, but more
often bare feet or clogs are preferred to traverse the mud of the poorer
quarters.  Most common men wear cloth or straw hats to keep out of the sun. 
Dockmen and other laborers wear the same baggy breeches, but are bare
chested with a long vest.  

The noble ladies wear long dresses with necklines cut to bare shoulders and
considerable bosom.  Silk is the material of preference and their dresses
are often adorned with a lace ruff and tiny matching cap.  Tairen widows
wear white, and have been known to wear the color while their dying husband
still lived.  No self-respecting lady is ever without her tiny bottle of
smelling salts.  

Common women wear chin-high collars that reveal nothing, and ankle-high
hems.  The dresses are often adorned with pale-colored aprons, usually in a
combination of two or three of progressively larger size, each smaller than
the one beneath it.  Hats, when worn, are wide-brimmed straw often dyed to
match the aprons.

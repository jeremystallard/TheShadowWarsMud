<PRE><H1>DEATH</H1>DEATH When your character takes enough damage that you can no longer
fight, you are not killed outright, only subdued.  

This means you can no longer interact with anyone until such time as you
either receive proper healing, or you heal on your own by means of rest. 
Subdual has various negative affects on experience, but it is still much
better than dying.  

It is however possible for your character to be killed outright.  In this
case, you lose all RP you have up to this point.  In essence you are not the
same character, you must begin all guild affiliations anew and make friends
again.  

Death is brought about by someone subdueing you while you are both
Completely IC (in RP mode) and then using the "finish" command to finish you
off.  You will be dropped to level 1 and sent through creation again, and
then given enough experience to make it back up to a certain percentage of
your old level.

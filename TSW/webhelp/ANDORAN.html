<PRE><H1>ANDORAN ANDOR</H1>The largest nation of the land, Andor is also one of the oldest.  It is a
large and wealthy nation reaching from the Mountains of Mist to the River
Erinin, though the decrease of population has prevented her Queens from
exercising their control of lands west of the River Manetherendrelle for
several generations.  Exports such as wool, precious metals and iron work,
tabac and grain give Andor a healthy economy.  The Andoran mark is more
highly valued and has more weight in gold than "equivalent" coins of other
nations.  

The sigil of Andor is a rampant white lion, also referred to as the White
Lion and her banner is that of a white lion rampant on a field of red.  Her
symbols include the Lion Throne and the Rose Crown of Andor.  Caemlyn in the
capital city.  

Andor is a country of many old traditions, the most widely known is that
only a queen may sit upon the Lion Throne and wear the Rose Crown, never a
king.  The eldest daughter is named Daughter-Heir.  By law, she is first
sent to the White Tower to study, then ascends the throne upon her mother's
death or retirement.  Her eldest brother is named the First Prince of the
Sword and is sworn to protect and defend his sister with his life.  The
First Prince is trained from childhood to command the Queen's armies in
times of war and to be her military advisor.  If the Queen has no surviving
brother, she appoints the First Prince.  

The people of Andor are usually fair-skinned, often with blue eyes and blond
hair, though dark eyes and hair are common.  Andoran women usually wear
dresses with square-cut necks showing little if any cleavage, and fitted
sleeves.  These dresses are occasionally embroidered with flowers and
leaves, and are worn belted at the waist.  Highborn ladies' dresses are
usually made of silk, with the embroidery and belt in metallic threads. 
Commoners wear the same basic style of dress, but of wool, usually with
higher necklines and with an apron.  

Andoran men wear trousers and shirts with a coat cover all.  The coat is
made with turned-back cuffs and an upstanding collar.  Among the nobility
the material is often silk or brocade, and the coat is often embroidered in
metallic threads.  Common men wear strong, serviceable wool.  

Men and woman both both wear cloaks as needed.  

Palace servants wear a livery of red with white collars and cuffs and the
White Lion of Andor upon their chests.  

The uniforms of the Queen's Guard include a red undercoat, gleaming mail and
plate armor, and a brilliant red cloak.  Long white collars hang over the
armor, and the white cuffs gleam at the wrist.  Their helmets are conical
with barred visors, and they often carry lances with thin red streamers
fluttering from their tips.  High ranking officers wear knots of rank on
their shoulder.  The Captain General wears four golden knots and wide gold
bands on his white cuffs.

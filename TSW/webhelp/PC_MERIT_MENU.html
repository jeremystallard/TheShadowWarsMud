<PRE><H1>PC_MERIT_MENU PC_FLAW_MENU PC_TALENT_MENU</H1>The Shadow Wars offer a wide range of unique merits, flaws and talents
for the players to select as their background and additional features to the
character.  

Available merits, flaws and talents are listed under each sub-menu and their
corresponding cost.  

Merits and Talents decrease the total points that are available and Flaws add
to the total points.  This allows you select if you want to take a flaw to
gain a merit or talent that would fit your character.  

Use '</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">add <merit/flaw/talent></FONT>' to add one to your character.  Use '</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">drop
<merit/flaw/talent></FONT>' to drop one from your character.  

There are also available help files for each of the merit, flaw and talent. 
Use '</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">help <merit/flaw/talent></FONT>' to read these help files.  

When you are satisfied with your adjustments type '</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">done</FONT>' to return back to
the selection menu.

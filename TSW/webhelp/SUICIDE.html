<PRE><H1>SUICIDE DELETE</H1>Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,
and you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will
return your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the
first delete.
 
The syntax to enter delete mode is: delete <password>

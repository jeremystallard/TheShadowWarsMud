<PRE><H1>CHANNELING ONEPOWER 'ONE POWER'</H1>Since this mud is based on Robert Jordan's series Wheel of Time, there
is no 'magic' system. The system that we use here is the 'channeling' system
which was incorporated into the series. The people who wielded the ability
to channel were known as channelers (aka channies in mud slang). By 'weaving'
5 'spheres', known as Air, Earth, Fire, Water and Spirit, they are able to
manipulate and control their environment in numerous ways.
 
First we will go over the basics of the ability to channel. The Power which is
used is known as the One Power, or True Source. This Power is divided into
two halves, Saidin and Saidar. Saidin is the male half of the one power, and
is known to be corrupt. For more help on this corruption, see 'help taint'. The
other half, Saidar, is the female half of the one power, which is not tainted
or corrupted. Great things were done in the Age of Legends, which is when both
halves of the One Power could be safely used. At this time, the last male
Aes Sedai has been dead several thousand years. It is said that the One Power,
or True Power (which very little at all is known of), is what turns the
Wheel of Time itself.
 
Weaving the one power is a complex thing to learn, requiring years of training
for most young women to master. By combining the five spheres, a channeler can
cause a great many things to occur. Each sphere has its strengths and
weaknesses, yet when brought together they can have surprising results.

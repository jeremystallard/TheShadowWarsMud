<PRE><H1>BOND_RULES BOND_GRANT</H1>Here on TSW the bond weave is given only to the Aes Sedai and the Aes
Sedai will be deciding who she will bond.  There are no major rules except
what is listed here so read closely.  

At this time there is no bonding of Whitecloaks, or Women.  If one decides
to bond a wolf or a male channeler then you take your fate into your own
hands, but we exspect that your RP will go in the unique direction that
bonding a wolfkin will head.  If you have any questions on that please ask
before you do.  There may come a time when it's possible but that time is
not now.  Don't ask to be an exception.  The bonding shall only occur if
both players agree to be bonded.  The character may have been forced to bond
but the players will have to agree to be bonded.  

The Aes Sedai will deal with her bad choice if it happens such as bonding
someone of low level or someone that can't defend her.  It was her choice,
her responsability.  

If the player bonds more than her Ajah allows her to bond, if the player
bonds another player without OOC consentiment, if the player teaches the
bond weave to anyone who is not an Aes Sedai, the weave will be removed from
the Aes Sedai and whoever she taught it (if she taught it to someone), the
bond will be undone and the Aes Sedai in question will be DELETED.  

- Green Ajah are aloud 2 bonds, Red Ajah are not allowed any bond, all the
rest are allowed 1 bond.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">-</FONT> There will be </FONT><FONT COLOR="red">no passing of the bond</FONT> to someone else.  This was not common
in the books, and it will not be common on TSW.  The AS-Warder bond was
between those two people, no other PC, regardless of guild rank, can order
the AS to pass her.  Bond to another.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">-</FONT> There will be </FONT><FONT COLOR="red">no unbonding</FONT>.  This is not something to take lightly, either
ICly or OOCly.  Once bonded, both parties are tied to each other forever,
until one of them dies.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="red">*</FONT> The only except to this rule is if one of the bonded pair does not log on
for a period of three REAL LIFE months, for more than 5 hours.  Then the
bonded PC who is left may petition to have the bond released.  The only way
the bond will be released and work in our RP environment, is for the missing
bonded person to die.  </FONT><FONT COLOR="white"> Thus, if you agree to be bonded, and then do not log
in your bonded character for three months, you also agree to have your
character's death written by your bonded partner, and your character will be
deleted.  </FONT> Bonding isn't to be taken lightly.  Choose wisely.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">-</FONT> Bond is </FONT><FONT COLOR="white">ONLY</FONT> available to an Aes Sedai within the White Tower.  Anyone who
is in the White Tower is eligible to receive it (via teaching from someone
else within the tower.)  </FONT><FONT COLOR="red">Note:</FONT> If an Aes Sedai </FONT><FONT COLOR="white">ever</FONT> teaches the bond weave
to someone outside the tower, both characters will be immediately DELETED!

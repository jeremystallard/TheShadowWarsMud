<PRE><H1>DODGE</H1>In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not
be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the
character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the 
target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the
attacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.

saying.  

Altara faces the Sea of Storms, wedged between the more powerful nations of
Illian and Amadicia, with northern borders touching Murandy, Andor, and
Ghealdan.  It is unified only in name.  Most of the inhabitants prefer to
identify themselves as belonging to a particular Lord or Lady, rather than a
subject of the Queen or a citizen of Altara.  Even the nobles seem to care
little for their nation, seldom paying taxes or offering more than lip
service to the Crown.  

The sigil of Altara is two golden leopards, one above the other.  The Golden
Leopards or the Leopards as it is often referred to.  It's banner is the
Golden Leopards on a field checked four by four in red and blue with red
being next to the staff on the topmost row.  Altara's capital city is Ebou
Dar and her symbol is the Throne of Winds.  She is ruled by a Queen.  

The Throne of Winds is slightly more than a prize to be taken by the most
powerful noble, although many powerful nobles have scorned to take it when
given the opportunity.  In the thousand years since Hawkwing's death, only
one house has held the throne for as much as five consecutive generations
and when they lost it their fall was so complete that the House had become
subservient to all others.  No other House has ever been able to put more
than two consecutive rulers on the throne.  Altara is under pressure from
Amadicia and there is no doubt that the Children of the Light wish to
control it, for its sovereignty is all that keeps them from controlling the
river trade on the Eldar, or marching on Murandy and perhaps even Illian. 
If not for Illian's intervention during the Whitecloak war, they would have
succeeded.  A weakly knit land such as Altara is an easy target for those
with the power to take it.  

Altara does have a national character though.  Her people, especially the
women, are fierce and bold.  They are extremely polite, yet quick to answer
an insult with steel.  Highborn or low, man or woman, all are equal on the
dueling ground.  This is most evident in the capital city of Ebou Dar,
center of Altaran culture and commerce.  

Altarans can often be recognized by their dark hair, dark eyes, and olive
complexion, but those from Ebou Dar are also easily recognized by their
distinctive attire.  Women's dresses are often pale in color with snug
bodices and full skirts over bright petticoats.  The necklines of commoners
are cut very narrow and deep, while for nobiles the bodice has a round or
oval cutout, allowing those with a marriage knife to show them to best
advantage, and those without to show that their available.  For commoners
the skirt is always worn gathered above one knee to reveal the brilliantly
colored petticoats beneath, while noblewomen wear it raised in the front. 
Large hoop earrings are worn by most women and some men.  Men and women
alike wear curved daggers through their belts or sashes, and often carry a
work knife as well.  

The trademark of the Ebou Dari man is his long, elaborate vest.  These vests
are often as brightly colored as a Tinker's clothes, and are worn alone or
over pale shirts with wide sleeves.  

Sometimes the wealthy add a decorative silk coat slung about the shoulders,
since it is deliberately too small to be worn conventionally.  This "cape"
is held with a chain of silver or gold strung between the narrow embroidered
lapels.  When the cape is worn a long narrow sword is usually carried, in
addition to the standard dagger.  Both men and women adorn their hands with
rings.  

As in most cultures, the wealthy use silks and brocades with embroidery,
often set with jewels, while the poor and middle-class use wool, brass, and
glass.  

The Ebou Dari pride themselves on the ferocity of their women, and their
courage to duel.  Very few men or women reach adulthood without having
fought in at least one duel, and these few are ostracized for being
cowardly.

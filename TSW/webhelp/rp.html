<PRE><H1>rp award</H1>In order to incentive more RP, The </FONT><FONT COLOR="darkgray">Shadow </FONT><FONT COLOR="darkred">Wars</FONT> has implemented a new
rewarding system.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="red">1.  </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="white"> The amount of people the character has RPed with during the week:</FONT> It's
important not only to RP, but also to seek RP with different characters that
are in the same area that you are icly.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="red">2.  </FONT><FONT COLOR="white"> The amount of hours the character had RPed compared to the amount of
hours the character has been online during the week:</FONT> We understand and
respect people's different log times and availability.  

</FONT><FONT COLOR="red">3</FONT>.  </FONT><FONT COLOR="white">The RPs that happened themselves:</FONT> How much thought was put in the RP,
how creative it was, if the person used of extra tools while RPing such as
echo command, restrings, control of NPCs.  Also, if the RP generated other
RPs afterwards.  

The more your character fill these categories, the better your reward will
be.

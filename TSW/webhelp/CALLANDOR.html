<PRE><H1>CALLANDOR</H1>Callandor is the name given to the crystal sword that is actually one of
the greatest saangreal ever made.  During the Breaking of the World it was
hidden and shielded within the Stone of Tear to prevent its use by the
maddened male Aes Sedai.  The prophecies stated that it would eventually be
claimed by the Dragon Reborn.  

The fall of the Stone of Tear and the claiming of Callandor were considered
to be two of the greatest signs that the Dragon had been Reborn.  

Callandor is an extremely powerful saangreal, among the greatest ever made. 
Perhaps only the two great saangreal originally constructed to seal the Dark
Ones prison are more powerful.  

But there are several problems inherent in the use of Callandor.  First, few
would even have the skill to handle the large flow of saidin the sword can
command.  Enough saidin could be channeled through this saangreal to level
an entire city.  

The greatest danger, though, comes from Callandor itself.  It is not
buffered in the same manner that other great saangreal were buffered.  As
such, the use of Callandor lends the user to believe that he can do
anything.  The more a man uses Callandor, the more this lack of a buffer
becomes apparent.  Callandor also magnifies the taint of saidin.  

But Callandor can safely be used under certain conditions.  A circle of one
man and two women, with one of the women leading, could safely wield
Callandor.  The current mistrust between Ashaman and Aes Sedai, though,
makes it unlikely that any such circle could be attempted.

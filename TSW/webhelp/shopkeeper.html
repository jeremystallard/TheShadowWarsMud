<PRE><H1>shopkeeper</H1>In order to create a shopkeeper, the mob must be added as the first reset
in the room.  Example: "reset </FONT><FONT COLOR="red">1</FONT> mob <vnum> </FONT><FONT COLOR="green">1</FONT> </FONT><FONT COLOR="blue">1</FONT>."  The red </FONT><FONT COLOR="red">1</FONT> symbolizes that
it is the first mob in the room.  The green </FONT><FONT COLOR="green">1</FONT> means that there is only one
of these shopkeepers/mobs in the area and the blue </FONT><FONT COLOR="blue">1</FONT> means that there is
only one of these shopkeepers/mobs in the room.  

Once the mob is typed in as the first reset, ALL of the objects he/she will
be selling should follow.  For example, he is selling an apple.  So, the
second reset should look like this: "reset 2 obj <vnum of apple> none" The
none means that it will not be worn anywhere on the mob.  When you type
"reset" you should see an S in the second reset's line - meaning that it is
now a shop item the keeper will be selling.  Continue this process for the
third, fourth, fifth, etc items that the shopkeeper will be selling.  

If you list a random object in the reset and type "none" in the reset
location, it WILL appear in the shopkeeper's list of things to sell. 
However, if you type a wear location in the object's reset, it will appear
in the shopkeeper's equipment list.  If you break up the shopkeeper's
selling list with another mob, it will mess up your shop list.  So, be sure
to list ALL of the objects you wish the shopkeeper to sell before using any
other reset values.  

Once your shopkeeper is done and all of his selling items have been reset,
purge the room.  Then, type "edit room reset" and "list" You should see all
the items that are for sell.  If not, you have done the resets incorrectly
and should try again or seek help.  

After you have read all of this, you might ask "How do I create a
shopkeeper?"  The answer is that you edit your mob and type "shop assign". 
This will turn your ordinary mob into a shop keeper.  Then, you will need to
set the shop hours, profit and shop type.  Let's start with shop hours.  If
you want your shop to be open all the time, you would set the shop hours
from 1 to 23.  Or, "shop hours 1 23".  Otherwise, you can vary your hours: 1
to 6, 10 to 15, etc.  

Next comes profit.  In editing your shopkeeper, you will see "Markup for
purchaser."  The default is 100%.  If you want the shopkeeper to buy back an
object for more than its worth, you set the markup higher than 100. 
Otherwise, set it lower.  Next, you will see "Markdown for seller."  This
will determine how much the object can be bought from the shopkeeper for. 
The default is 100%.  If you purchase an item, you see that the shopkeeper
haggles with you.  If you want him to sell the object to the buyer for more
than it is worth, set the value higher than 100.  If he will sell it for
less than it is worth, set it lower than 100.  

Shop profit values are set by typing "shop profit 100 100".  The first 100
being the markup, the second 100 being the markdown.  

Finally, shop type.  These will need to be set to allow the shopkeeper to
buy back items.  Traditionally, he should only buy back the same type of
items he sells.  For example, if he is only selling a canteen, he should
only buy back drink containers.  So, you would set his shop type as "shop
type 0 drinkcontainer".  For each additional object you are listing in the
shop types, use 1, 2, 3, etc.

Arafel lies just west of Shienar and is made up of more rugged country than
Shienar.  The men are easily recognized by their distinctive hairstyle. 
They wear their hair in two long braids, usually with silver bells on the
braid-ends.  Most of the natives of Arafel are pale-skinned and appear to
have unusually large eyes.  Like all Borderlanders, the Arafellin maintain a
strong military tradition for protection from creatures of the Blight. 
Arafellin warriors are skilled swordsmen.  They always wear two swords, both
strapped to their backs, one hilt over each shoulder, and are capable of
using both at once, one in each hand.  

Traditionally, Arafel is ruled by a King with the country's sigil being one
red rose and one white roses, or the Roses.  It's banner is of three white
roses on a field of red quartered with three red roses on a field of white. 
The capital city of Arafel is Shol Arbela.

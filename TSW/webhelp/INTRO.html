The Shadow Wars is using an introduction system that prevents two players
who have never met from instantly knowing each other name.

As you meet other players, you will see the appearances until you are
introduced to them, and them to you.

Use 'intro <player>' to introduce your name to one player only.

Use 'intro room' to introduce your name to all players in the room you are
standing in.

Players that you have introduced your self to and that haven't introduced
them self back to you will have a (</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">NIB</FONT>) flag in front of their appearance.

Players that have introduced them self to you, but you haven't introduced
your self to will have a (</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">YNIB</FONT>) flag in front of their appearnace.

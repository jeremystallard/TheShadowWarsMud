He had helped make the Trollocs, blending human and animal stock--he was
proud of that, of the skill involved, the difficulty--but these occasional

understanding molecules and atoms better than any other.  He always wanted
to do genetic experiments, but wasn't allowed to by the Hall of Servants,
being disciplined many times for experiments on animals.  He pledged to the
Dark One in the first thirty years of the Collapse.

and had sunken eyes and yellowed teeth.  No finger nails and knuckles
gnarled and barely human.

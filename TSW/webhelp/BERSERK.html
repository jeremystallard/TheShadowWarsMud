<PRE><H1>BERSERK</H1>Only powerful characters can master berserking, the ability to enter
insane rage in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy
spell -- a huge surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for
personal safety.  Berserking characters are more resistant to the effects of
weaves.

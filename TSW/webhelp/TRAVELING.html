<PRE><H1>TRAVELING TRAVEL</H1>The ability to open a gateway directly from one location to another. 
Anyone of sufficient strength and knowledge can Travel.  Traveling requires
detailed knowledge of the place one is Traveling from.  Gaining sufficient
knowledge takes several hours.  (ACoS, Ch9) However, when Traveling a very
short distance almost no knowledge is needed.  (ACoS, Ch41) It is not
necessary to face the direction that you want to Travel, but for some, it
helps.  (TPoD, Ch21)

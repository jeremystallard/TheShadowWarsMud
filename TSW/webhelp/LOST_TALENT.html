<PRE><H1>LOST_TALENT</H1>By the first century AB, letters reliably attributed to Aes Sedai
spoke of forgotten Talents and lost abilities, and bemoaned the vast
knowledge of the Power that is gone and may be centuries in the rediscovery.

Choosing the 'lost talent' talent does not guarantee that your character
spark any talent, nor give the player a carte blanche to RP having any lost
talent they wish.  

However, you have a small chance to spark a talent the letters to the Aes
Sedai speak of.  Which talents are lost is unknown until such a day where
one with the ability spark a lost talent.

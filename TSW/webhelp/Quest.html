<PRE><H1>Quest </H1>Questing:

There is a questmaster in the game available for those people who find they
would like a little extra challenge.  When you find her (or him) he (or she)
will send you after a 'missing item' or a 'criminal'.  

Upon either executing the criminal or finding the quest item, you need to
return it to the questmaster to complete your quest.

Syntax:

quest request : request a new quest

quest time : See how much time is left on your quest, or see how long until
you can quest again 

quest info : Show you what you're looking for again.  

quest complete : Complete your quest and collect your reward

quest quit : The quest is too hard, I want to give up.  

quest list : List what you can buy with your quest points.  (Note, these are
seperate than the quest tokens given by imms) 
 
quest lore <item> : Lore an item to identify it prior to purchasing.

quest buy <item> : Purchase an item with your quest points

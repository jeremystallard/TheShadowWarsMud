Of course, it's only a rough estimate.
In order of difficulty, the current messages are:
 
is not worth the effort
You won't even break a sweat
Looks like he'd be good for sparring practice
Looks like it'd be a fair fight
might hurt a bit
could be taken, on a really good day
Will bring on the pain
and
Just walk away

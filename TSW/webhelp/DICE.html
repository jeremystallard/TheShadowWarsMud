<PRE><H1>DICE DICING GAMES</H1>In order to be able to dice, you must be at a mob that will allow gaming.  
 
Current games are: higher-lower, even-odd, and high-low.
 
The syntax is as follows: "dice <name of game> <amount bet>"
 
For example, "dice even-odd 1000"
 
You must put the "-" between the game names or it will not work.

The 'bind' command allows you to tie a victim that is subdued to make
sure they don't trail off when they get back their consciousness.
 
The 'free' command will try to free a victim that is tied up.
It is harder to free someone that a more skilled person has
tied up.
 
The 'escape' command is for those who wake up after a subdue and find
them self tied up, or has surrendered and is tied up, to try escape
from their bonds.

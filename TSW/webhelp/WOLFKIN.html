<PRE><H1>WOLFKIN</H1>Very few humans are aware of new abilities, thought by some to be Old
Talents, some which have little or nothing to do with the One Power.  The
ability to sense the presence of wolves and to speak to the wolves mentally
in a sort of image language is one of these.  

Those who have this talent, sometimes called Wolfbrothers or Wolfkin, risk a
certain type of madness and insanity.  Developing Wolfbrother abilities too
fast has a great impact on the risk of madness.  Slow integration allows one
to deal with the changes in the body and mind.  These changes are a product
of the wolf-like animal urges which may overwhelm the Wolfbrother's human
side.  As a result of this process, Wolfbrothers possess several distinctive
physical features.  Their eyes turn a shade of golden-yellow, their beards
and hair grow more quickly and thickly, and their face becomes a little
longer and sharper, somtimes with little points developing on the tips of
the ears.  

Aside from the physical results of the change, Wolfbrothers also have a
heightened senses, such as smell.  Some Wolfbrothers claim they are able to
tell some emotions by scent, such as fear.  Also they have the ability to
enter what is known as the Wolf Dream, which is known to others as
Tel'aran'rhiod.

<PRE><H1>Malkier Malkieri</H1>Until its fall in 953 NE, Malkier was one of the oldest modern nations,
having been the first one to rebuild after the Hundred Years War.  It was
bordered by the Mountains of Dhoom to the north with Shienar and Arafel to
the south.  Before it's fall, it was a beautiful land with many lakes and
mountain vistas.  Though a noble land that strived to keep the Dark at bay,
jealously in the royal family led to the weakening of its armies and soon it
was unable to defend itself against the Trollocs that took advantange of
this weakness.  The survivors went south into the other Borderlands and
Malkier fell.  Today, most people of the Borderlands do not like to talk
about what happened to Malkier as it is a tragic story to tell.  

The Kings of Malkier were titled Lord of the Seven Towers, and Lord of the
Lakes, the last referring to Malkiers legendary thousand lakes.  Each of its
kings and queens took an oath to fight against the Shadow, and the king
carried a sword that never dulled.  The ruler of Malkier was a "Dai Shan",
which is Old Tongue ofr Diademed Battle Lord.  Unlike in other lands, the
spouse of the king or queen ruled just as equally as the king or queen
themself.  When a King would die, the Great Lords of the land would cast
rods upon the Crowning Stone to select the new king.  

Most refugees adopted the culture of their new homes.  There are a few here
and there who maintain the old ways, however they are losing more and more
of their culture as the years pass.  

Malkier was very military oriented.  Men wore their hair at shoulder length,
held off their faces with a thing, braided leather cord around the temples
called a 'hadori'.  The hadori symbolized their dedication to opposing the
Blight.  Women painted small dots call ki'sain in the center of their
foreheads, indicating their sons were pledged to fight the Shadow.  Malkieri
were usually tall, with dark, often black hair.  Women wore their hair loose
and long, usually down past their waists.  Women in mourning cut their hair
to shoulders or shorter.  A woman of marriageable age wore a blue ki'sain, a
woman mourning wore one of white.  Women preferred lightly-worked silk
dresses and the men wore coats in the Borderlands style.  Boys hair was left
long, cut to the shoulders only when they were deemed mature.  The cut hair
was often braided into a rope called a 'daori' of which the boy would give
to his first lover, called a 'carneira'.  Both men and women had carneira,
who were usually older than they were.  Young women chose their carneira and
young men were chosen by theirs.  Malkieri men had a saying that "your
carneira wears a part of your soul as a ribbon in her hair forever". 
Malkieri men were very protective of women and considered it rude to look
them full in the eyes.

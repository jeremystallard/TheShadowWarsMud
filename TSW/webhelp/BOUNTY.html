Syntax: bounty list

The bounty system is now an ic system.  That means that both attackers need
to be flagged ic to get the money at the time you sub someone.  You only
have to SUB them, you do not have to FINISH them.  If you icly go after a
bounty, then you should have some ic reason to do so, and follow it up with
a story about the fight.  This way it will help foster more rp.  

BOUNTY <name> <amount> will extract gold from you and place it on a person's
head.  The next player to kill the person with the bounty gets to keep the
gold.  The bounty is cumulative so that if a certain guild wants someone
dead really badly, everyone in the guild can chip in on the bounty.  

BOUNTY LIST or BOUNTYLIST will show all players currently logged in with a
bounty on their heads.

<PRE><H1>CLIENT CLIENTS MUDCLIENT BOT BOTTING</H1>Many people use mud clients to make it easier to get around the game. 
They set triggers to pick things up, use paths to get from one place to
another, and use variables to store gate keys.  

The one requirement that we have is that you MUST be at the keys while using
your client.  Short trips afk to get a drink of water or take a bio-break
are acceptable.  Hours away while your character uses triggers to kill mob
after mob autonomously is not acceptable.  

Using triggers and timers to keep your character online is acceptable at the
moment, but we request that you use common courtesty when doing so.  Idling
in a heavily used levelling area in order to slow down repop is frowned
upon.  Of course, this brings up what does "frowned upon" mean.  It means
all sorts of things depending on how bad of a day that the Imm that has to
deal with it has had.  

Rest assured, if you get annoying, the immortals may get very creative.

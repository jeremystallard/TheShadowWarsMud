Darkfriends are those that pledged themselves to the Dark One or how call
him, The Great Lord of the Dark.  They do the Great Lord's bidding through
high ranked darkfriends, dreadlords and the Forsaken.  The path of a
darkfriend is a dangerous one so think carefully before you join the forces
of the Dark because the command is irreversible.  Darkfriends don't
advertise who they are to other people, doing so will most likely have the
darkfriend killed by the local authorities.  
 
When you choose the path of a darkfriend you need to choose a new name, your
darkfriend name.  Remember that using the name of other players as your
dfname is illegal and that using any unsuitable word or words that would
cause you to get fined on public channels will result in punishment by the
Immortals.  Your darkfriend name can be as colorful as you wish, just
remember to close the color code.
 
Your dfname will only be known to the Forsaken and maybe a very limited
circle that has a higher rank than you.  Dfname will not show on the
wholist.

The tie command allow a channeler that is sustaining flows that are combined
into a weave to tie a knot on them. This makes the channeler able to release his or hers
focus from the weave as long as the knot is in place.
 
The untie command allows a channeler to try to remove an already tied off weave by
removing the knot on it.

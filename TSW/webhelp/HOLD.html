Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start
using it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources.  And WEAR is for armor. 
WIELD is for weapons.  

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.  

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if it is too heavy for
you, or if you are not experienced enough to use it properly.  

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.

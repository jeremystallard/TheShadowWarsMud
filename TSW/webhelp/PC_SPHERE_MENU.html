<PRE><H1>PC_SPHERE_MENU</H1>All channelers start with a basis sphere potential for each of the five
spheres.  You are allowed to use a given amount of points to adjust your
spheres up and down according to what would fit the character best.  

The rank in the spheres identify your potential in each of the five spheres.
A higher rank means you have a higher potential in that sphere.  

Spheres can be set from rank 1 to rank 10, where 1 identify a weak potential
and 10 a great potential.  

Setting a sphere rank low/high will affect both how well you can combine
flows and how strong it will be.  

You may also set one of the five spheres as your main sphere.  This will
give you an edge in flows that greatly require this flow.  It will also give
you a additional bonus in your potential.  

When you are satisfied with your sphere adjustments type '</FONT><FONT COLOR="white">done</FONT>' to return

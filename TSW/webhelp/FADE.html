<PRE><H1>FADE MYRDDRAAL LURKS SHADOWMEN HALFMEN NEVERBORN FETCHES FADES</H1>When Trollocs mate and they fail to produce another Trolloc, there is a
possibilty of a throwback to the human side of their genetic makeup.  What
is produced is called a Myrddraal.  These creatures are on par in
intelligence with most humans, and looks somewhat similar, save a few
distinct differences.  They are tall, and sometimes described as handsome,
everyone nearly identical to the next, moving with a characteristic grace
often likened to the movements of a snake or serpant.  Their skin is pale,
pale white, their hair is dark black, and no facial hair is ever seen on
them.  Their blood is said to be black, and the most disturbing thing is
perhaps their lack of eyes, for where they should be there is only skin. 
Despite this, these creatures can indeed see, and rumor says they can even
see in dark; some say they live and travel in the shadows.  

Myrddraal, or Fades as they ae commonly called, control Trollocs as their
commanders in battle.  There is also talk that some Fades may link with
those Trollocs they lead, in effect being able to control them, however, at
the same time becoming the death of all of those linked Trollocs should the
Fade be killed.  

Unique to the Fades are their blades, forged in Thakan'dar.  These sword are
black, forged by shadowforgers.  Called shadow blades, they are dipped in
the black tainted streams of Shayol Ghul and 'seasoned' by a human soul.  A
mere scratch from the blade will bring death, and only the One Power can
heal or slow its affect.

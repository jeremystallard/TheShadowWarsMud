<PRE><H1>ENDURANCE HITPOINTS</H1>ENDURANCE is the measure of your character's stamina and remaining
energy.  This is used for movement, combat, and when using the One Power.  

HITPOINTS are the measure of your character's health.  The lower your
character's hitpoints, the closer they are to fainting or perhaps death. 
Both mobs and players attacking your character creates the possibilty of a
lowering of your hitpoints, as well as being poisoned by berries or another
source.

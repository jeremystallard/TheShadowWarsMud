<PRE><H1>FORETELLING FORETELL</H1>The ability to see part of the Pattern.  Very rare.  It is closely linked
with Dreaming.  (TGH, Ch12) Elaida a'Roihan, Gitara Moroso and Nicola
Treehill have the Talent.  Although always true, Foretellings are often very
difficult to interpret.  See Prophecies for specific Foretellings.  

Some with the Talent only have one or two visions in their lifetime.  Linked
to the One Power, only those who can channel may have a Foretelling.

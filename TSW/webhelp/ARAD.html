Arad Doman lies between the Mountains of Mist and the Aryth Ocean, just
north of the Almoth Plain.  Though the plain is officially unclaimed, Arad
Doman has long maneuvered for control of it against Tarabon.  The Domani
believe they are descendants of those who made the Tree of Life, but it is
the Domani women that are legendary.  Copper-skinned and exceedingly
graceful, they are said to be able to twist a man around their wrist with a
look, and imprison his heart with a smile.  The clothes they wear are
considered scandalous by most other standards.  Their dresses cover their
bodies from neck to toes, but are barely opaque and cling to every curve,
revealing nothing while hinting at everything.  Only the women of the Sea
Folk move with more sensual grace than the Domani, and no other woman can
compare to the Domani when it comes to practicing the art of seduction,
which mothers begin teaching their daughters in girlhood.  Most Domani
merchants are women, and the nation owes its wealth to their success.  Few
men come off victor in trade with a Domani woman, but they often consider
losing worth the experience.  

Domani men are recognizable by their long, thin mustaches and earrings. 
Both men and women of nobility wear jewelry engraved or embossed with the
symbols of their House.  As much as the women are known for their beauty,
the men are known for their temper.  It has been suggested that it is
dealing with Domani women which gives them such a temper.  Others say it is
eating with 'sursa'.  (Sursa is pretty much chopsticks.  They use them in
Arad Doman) 

The capital of Arad Doman is Bandar Eban, also their trade center.  Though
the Domani do not like to travel the sea, Domani merchants carry on major
trade with the Sea Folk, and then disperse the goods to inland consumers. 
They also trade heavily with Tarabon and Saldaea.  Their sigil is a silver
hand grasping a silver sword by the blade, point down...  The Sword and
Hand, and their banner is the Sword and Hand on a field of four green and
three blue horizontal stripes.

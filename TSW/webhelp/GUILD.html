<PRE><H1>GUILD GUILDS CLAN CLANS</H1>1) Four players are required to start a new guild, and must stay active
for a guild to continue to stay open.  To petition for a new guild, the four
players need to note to guild admin, in the guild note area.  This does not
guarantee that the guild will be opened, and will be at the discretion of
the admin.  Subguilds will subsequently be opened on an as needed basis.  

2) Guild leaders rank 1-3 must log on for a minimum of five hours per week,
being visible to the guild and the mud for guild matters and RP.  If the
guild leader is going to be away from the mud, a note to the guild and guild
admin explaining the absense is expected.  While this is the minimum time,
attention will be paid to the following rule as well.  

3) Guild leaders rank 1-2 must play their leader character as their primary
character, or risk losing not only the position, but that character.  This
does not mean that guildleaders may not play alts, but if the admin notices
that the guild leader is neglecting their guild leader alt for another alt,
then the admin may choose for something untoward to happen to the guild
leader to allow others more willing to put time and RP into the position to
have a chance at it.  
 
* Guilds thrive when their leaders are logging on and taking an active role
in the guild.  Guild leaders have a responsibility toward this end, and
shirking it may cause the player to lose the guild leader position, as well
as their character.  
 
4) A person with a guild leader character (guild level 1-3) may not have his
or her alt(s) raise any higher than guild level 4.  
 
5) Guild leaders rank 1-2 may not be absence for more than 2 weeks without
notice.

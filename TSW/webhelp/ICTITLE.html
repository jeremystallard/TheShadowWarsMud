Syntax: ictitle reset
 
IC titles are considered to be in-character and to reflect your current
dressing, or as an extention to your appearance. All characters start off
with a blank 'ictitle', but it free to change this to fit into your RP.
 
Remember that your current doing always will be following after your ICtitle.
Therefore always leave your itcitle without a '.' at the end.
 
ICtitles will show as: (Flag) (Name) <Appearance> <ICtitle> <Doing>.
 
ICtitle reset will reset your current ictitle to a totally blank string.

the one in you good hand, the weapon in your off-hand will be switched to your
good hand.
 
The 'draw' command will draw a sheathed weapon into your good hand, or your
off-hand if you know the dual wield skill.
 
The 'draw' command with a weapon name as argument will try to draw that weapon
into either your good hand or your off-hand.
